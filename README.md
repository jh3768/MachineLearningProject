#  Automatic Summarization of Article Using Regularised SVM and Naive Bayes


Objective:
For a large content of text file, we want to retrieve the most important information and summarize the content in a few lines of words. In other words, we want to reduce a large amount of data into a useful small amount of data by extracting the most important content. The data comes from the web in a specific field (e.g. political news, reports).
