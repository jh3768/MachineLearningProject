Everest legend Edmund Hillary dies - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- Edmund Hillary , who gained worldwide fame after he and guide Tenzing Norgay became the first people to reach the summit of Mount Everest , has died after suffering a heart attack .

New Zealander Hillary , who was 88 , died at Auckland City Hospital on Friday morning at 0900 local time , Hillary family spokesman Mark Sainsbury said .
' He had been in good form and been looking forward to coming home , and had remained in good spirits to the end, ' Sainsbury said in a statement issued by the Hillary family .

' The family are honored to accept the government 's offer of a state funeral , recognizing the impact he had on all New Zealanders .
They are also comforted by the messages of support from around the country and around the world .

Funeral arrangements would not be set until family members had returned from overseas , Sainsbury said .

' His great friends the Sherpa people have called [ his wife ] June and are organizing their own memorial service in Nepal. '

On May 29 , 1953 , Hillary and Tenzing became the first men known to have climbed the 29,035 feet to the top of Everest and safely return .

A beekeeper who served during World War II in the Royal New Zealand Air Force , Hillary began climbing while in high school and traveled to the central Himalayas to join a British party exploring the southern face of Everest in 1951 .

He returned in 1953 , when he and Tenzing made their ascent -- spending 15-30 minutes at the summit .
Hillary left a crucifix at the top of the mountain and Tenzing , in keeping with his Buddhist beliefs , left an offering of food .

Hillary took a picture of Tenzing at the peak but , because the Sherpa guide did not know how to use a camera , there are no pictures of Hillary there .

He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II upon his return to England , but continued exploring -- reaching the South Pole by tractor in 1958 , joining the first group to climb Antarctica 's Mt .
Herschel in 1967 and boating east Himalayan rivers and the Ganges .

Prime Minister Helen Clark paid tribute to Hillary , describing him as the best-known New Zealander ever to have lived .

' Sir Ed described himself as an average New Zealander with modest abilities, ' Clark said .

' In reality , he was a colossus .
He was an heroic figure who not only 'knocked off ' Everest but lived a life of determination , humility and generosity. '

Flags throughout New Zealand flew at half-mast on Friday , while callers flooded talkback stations with tributes to Hillary .

Many shared anecdotes of personal meetings with the late adventurer , describing him as an iconic New Zealander whose achievements were important to both the country and the world .

Antarctica New Zealand chief executive Lou Sanson said his enduring image of Hillary was his love of the natural environment of the frozen continent .

' Most of all you could tell he was in love with what was outside , which was that wild , harsh continent and the ability to live in that, ' Sanson said .

In his later years , Hillary became a strong supporter of environmental causes and worked to improve the lives of Nepal 's Sherpas .

His Himalayan Trust has helped build schools , hospitals and airstrips in Nepal since 1961 .

Hillary was not always complimentary of the more than 1,300 people who have climbed Everest since he did .
In 2006 , he harshly criticized a group of about 40 climbers that left Englishman David Sharp , 34 , to die as they kept climbing to the top of Everest .

' Human life is far more important than just getting to the top of a mountain, ' he said at the time .
' I think the whole attitude toward climbing Mt .
Everest has become rather horrifying -- the people just want to get to the top, ' he said of the mountain .

In 2003 , Hillary was made an honorary citizen of Nepal on the 50th anniversary of his historic climb .
Mount Everest is 8,848 meters ( 29,028 feet ) high , according to the widely accepted Survey of India , which took place between 1952 and 1954 .

But controversy has raged during recent years as to the height of the world 's tallest mountain , which has been variously said to be 8,848.11 meters high ( 29,029.24 feet , determined by a Chinese survey in 1975 ) , 8,872 meters high ( 29,108 feet , judged by an Italian survey in 1987 ) and 8,846 meters high ( 29,023 feet , from a further Italian survey in 1992 ) .
