Hey, where's my ride? - CNN.com
( Tribune Media Services ) -- Her vacation package includes transfers from the airport to her hotel .
But when she lands in Kingston , Jamaica , there 's no van to pick her up .
What does N.M. Johnston 's tour operator , Apple Vacations , owe her ?

Q : What are your rights when a tour operator fails to deliver part of your vacation package ?
I booked a one-week vacation in Ocho Rios , Jamaica , through Apple Vacations recently .
It included accommodations and transfers to and from the airport .

But when we arrived in Kingston , we discovered that the shuttle bus did n't run from Kingston , but from Montego Bay .
We had to pay $ 160 for a taxi ride from Kingston to the hotel .
We also had to pay $ 75 to change our return flights to leave from Montego Bay instead of Kingston .

I immediately contacted Apple Vacations at the resort , but they were no help .
I was referred to Apple 's headquarters in Pennsylvania , and I wrote an e-mail asking to be reimbursed for my expenses .
They refused .
Is there anything you can do to help ?

A : Apple should have picked you up from the airport and taken you to your hotel , as promised .
If it failed to do that , the company should cover your cost of transportation to your hotel .

But did Apple know you were on your way ?
I contacted the company , and it says it did n't .
When Apple reviewed your file , it discovered a 'glitch ' in its reservation system that would confirm a passenger has transfers from any airport in Jamaica , when in reality , all of Apple Vacations ' Jamaica services originate solely from the Montego Bay airport , according to Sandy Babin , Apple 's vice president of marketing .

Babin says if your travel agent had advised Apple that you were flying out of Kingston , the company would have confirmed that transfers were only available to and from Montego Bay .
But I do n't think your agent could have known that Apple was experiencing computer problems , and unless your travel professional booked a lot of Apple tours to Jamaica , it would n't have been possible to know the company only offers transfers from Montego Bay .

I might have been a little reluctant to pay for a taxi or a ticket change .
In addition to Apple Vacations , you should have contacted your travel agent ( who , after all , took a sizeable commission when you paid for your vacation ) and the hotel you 're supposed to stay at , which might have been able to recommend a less expensive way of getting to the property .

I definitely would n't have taken an initial 'no ' from Apple Vacations as a final answer .
You could call back and ask to speak with a supervisor or e-mail someone at a higher level at Apple Vacations .
Here 's a hint : e-mail addresses are first initial , followed by last name -- all one word -- @ applevac.com .
Happy e-mailing !

If none of those steps are successful , consider a credit card dispute or a trip to small claims court .
With such a small amount at stake , odds are the company would n't have sent a representative to court and would have lost by default .

Apple Vacations apologized for the transfer problem and sent you two $ 150 vacation certificates .
