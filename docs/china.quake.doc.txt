Quake lake water surges through cities - CNN.com
BEIJING , China ( CNN ) -- A huge volume of water Tuesday surged from a lake created by China 's massive earthquake , safely plunging downstream through an area where hundreds of thousands had been braced for disaster , officials said .

The mammoth effort to drain Tangjiashan lake -- where floodwaters behind a landslide had threatened to burst through the wall of rubble to submerge low-lying towns -- was declared a success by officials who said the crisis was over .

But with the risk of man-made drainage channels collapsing under pressure from the water charging through them , there was still a danger of sudden tidal waves .

The official Xinhua news agency reported late Tuesday that a crest of flood water , carrying with it trees , TVs , refrigerators and the bodies of earthquake victims , had surged safely past the city of Mianyang in southwestern Sichuan province .

Up to 250,000 people had already been evacuated from the area ahead of the deluge , but 400,000 remained in the city , where minor flooding and damage to buildings was reported as the torrent surged past .

The flood waters were released earlier by engineers and troops who had toiled for days using mechanical diggers , dynamite and anti-tank weapons to blast drainage channels through the landslide dam .

Sichuan province 's top official , Liu Qibao , claimed the effort a 'decisive victory, ' Xinhua said , according to The Associated Press .

It was feared that a breach in the dam could threaten areas downstream that are home to more than 1.3 million people .

Meanwhile , officials found the crash site of a Chinese military helicopter that went down late last month in the mountains of southwestern China , killing 19 people , state-run media reported .

The transport was carrying a crew of five along with 14 injured residents from Sichuan province on May 31 when it crashed in 'fog and turbulence ' near Yingxiu in Wenchuan County , a military source told the Xinhua news agency .

The flight was a part of rescue efforts following the May 12 earthquake that devastated much of the region .

More than 69,000 people died in the May 12 quake , but more than 17,000 remain missing , according to the official government toll .
