Release Chinese from Gitmo, U.S. lawmakers urge - CNN.com
WASHINGTON ( AP ) -- Lawmakers chastised the Bush administration on Wednesday for allowing the Chinese government to interrogate Chinese Muslim detainees at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , and demanded that they be freed in the United States .

The two lawmakers , Reps. Bill Delahunt , D-Massachusetts , and Dana Rohrabacher , R-California , said the Uighurs -- members of a Chinese ethnic group -- should be compensated and apologized to for any abuse they may have suffered while held in the detention center at U.S. naval base in Cuba .

Uighurs fled their homeland in western China and settled in Afghanistan and Pakistan , only to be swept up in the U.S.-led dragnet for terrorists after the September 11 attacks .

A federal judge has called their imprisonment unlawful , but the Bush administration opposes releasing them unless they can go to a country other than the United States .

At a House Foreign Affairs hearing on interrogation methods at Guantanamo , Delahunt asked Justice Department Inspector General Glenn A. Fine to confirm that Chinese officials were let into the prison .

' We were informed that the Chinese government sent people to interview and interrogate the Uighurs, ' Fine said .

Additionally , Fine said , FBI officials reported that U.S. military personnel woke Uighurs every 15 minutes in a sleep-depravation interrogation tactic known as 'the frequent flyer program ' before the Chinese interrogators arrived .

' Did they draw the conclusion that this was , that we had American military personnel collaborating , doing this to , if you will , soften up the Uighurs for examination by Chinese communist agents ?
' Delahunt asked .

Fine answered : 'They reported this was the technique that was used , what they call the frequent flyer program , to put the Uighurs in a position to be interrogated by the Chinese government. '

Rohrabacher called the military 's involvement 'ridiculous .
' He said the Uighurs should be freed in the U.S .

' And we will call on the government to do so forthwith, ' Rohrabacher said .
' And if it indeed looks like they 've been unjustly treated that we offer some compensation as well as an apology. '

Both lawmakers agreed to push the Bush administration to release the Uighurs in the U.S. , although Delahunt predicted that Rohrabacher , a Republican , 'will have more access to the powers that be than I will. '

White House spokesman Tony Fratto declined to comment on the issue , and a spokesman for the State Department did not immediately return a call seeking comment .

Under U.S. law , the Uighur men can not be sent back to China because they are likely to face persecution and torture .
The administration has been seeking refuge for them in other nations , and five were sent to Albania in 2006 .
As of two months ago , 17 Uighurs remained at Guantanamo , awaiting countries to take them .

In March , State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said the U.S. has 'no desire to be the world 's jailer , and we look forward to the day Guantanamo is shut down .
And part of that solution is working with other countries to take people back under the right circumstances. '

A report by the human rights group Center for Constitutional Rights indicates that officials from at least 17 countries have been allowed to interrogate their citizens being held at Guantanamo .
The report accuses interrogators from six nations -- China , Uzbekistan , Libya , Jordan , Tajikistan and Tunisia -- of abusing Guantanamo detainees with the consent of U.S. officials .

The group has for the past seven years sought access to U.S. courts for detainees at Guantanamo .
