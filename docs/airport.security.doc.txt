More airports to use 'whole body imaging' machines - CNN.com
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Some travelers at key airports in New York and Los Angeles may be put through machines that see through clothing and provide a detailed image of a person 's body beginning later this week .

It 's the first expansion of the program since the machines were first put to the test in Phoenix , Arizona .

The 'whole body imaging ' machines have sparked complaints from privacy advocates .

But the Transportation Security Administration says that it has taken steps to protect individuals ' privacy and that 90 percent of the travelers in Phoenix preferred the imaging machine to a pat-down .

The millimeter wave machines will be rolled out at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York and Los Angeles International Airport in California later this week , TSA Administrator Kip Hawley told Congress on Tuesday .

The TSA will be purchasing at least 30 more machines for use at other U.S. airports this year , he added .

The TSA will use two different methods at JFK and LAX as they study the most effective way to use the machines .

At JFK , passengers sent to secondary screening will be given the option of a pat-down or a trip through the body imager .
To protect the traveler 's privacy , the screener who reviews the image is in a booth , unable to see the traveler , according to the TSA .
The traveler 's face is pixilated and the image is not stored , the TSA said .

At LAX , the millimeter wave machine will be located just beyond the checkpoint magnetometers .

Travelers will continuously and randomly be selected to go through the machine .
While signs will inform them of the pat-down option , screeners will not announce that choice .
But passengers electing not to go through the millimeter wave machine will be given the option of the pat-down .

A TSA spokesman said the agency is still exploring backscatter , another imaging technology in use at Phoenix 's Sky Harbor International Airport .

Millimeter wave machines are already in use at airports in Britain , Spain , Japan , Australia , Mexico , Thailand and the Netherlands , as well as at some court and corrections facilities in Virginia , Colorado , Pennsylvania , California and Illinois .

Sky Harbor began using the machines last October .

Hawley also announced Tuesday the TSA is purchasing another 580 multi-view X-ray machines that are used to screen passengers ' carry-on bags , bringing the total to 830 machines .
The machines give screeners a clearer , more detailed view .
Some 600 machines will be deployed by year 's end , he said .

The technology is a 'powerful platform ' that can be adjusted to include software capable of detecting liquid explosives , he said .
