Airports focus on 'security that you can't see' - CNN.com
INDIANAPOLIS , Indiana ( AP ) -- Nine bulky luggage scanners worth $ 1 million each wait silently beneath the new terminal , poised to check for explosives at a combined rate of 3,600 bags an hour .

Concrete bollards guard the main doors .
Blast-resistant glass fills the front windows of the $ 1.1 billion terminal at Indianapolis International Airport , which will open this fall .

New and renovated airports have poured millions of dollars into safety upgrades since the September 11 terrorist attacks , working advice from explosives experts into design plans that encompass everything from the most secure place for parking garages to more efficient security checkpoints .

' We have n't had to dig a moat around the terminal or anything, ' said Jay McQueen , deputy project director for the Indianapolis terminal .
' It 's been an incremental set of changes to help make everything more secure. '

The September 11 attacks , in which hijackers seized control of airliners leaving from Boston , Newark and Washington , triggered a massive re-examination of airport security .
Passengers saw the formation of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration shortly after the attacks , and they 've since become used to spending more time in security checkpoints having their shoes x-rayed and carrying only limited amounts of liquids .

But many other upgrades fly beneath their radar .

' We like to say around here that the best kind of security is the security that you ca n't see, ' said Ken Capps , vice president of public affairs for the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport , which opened a new international terminal in 2005 .

In Indianapolis , those steps include the bollards , windows that will fold like a drape when broken rather than exploding into shards of flying glass , and a 240-foot-wide strip of lawn that will separate the front entrance of the new terminal from its five-story parking garage .

The grassy median , which will be planted between the garage and a road leading up to the terminal , is n't for pastoral effect .
It 's the product of a federal mandate requiring all buildings that hold cars be kept at least 300 feet from an airport terminal .
Blast analysis , which looks at how a building withstands an explosion , has become a routine part of airport design , said Tom Darmody , senior vice president of aviation and transportation for the design firm HOK .

' For the most part , people were n't even thinking about this 'til after 9/11, ' said Andy Bell , vice president of planning at the Dallas/Fort Worth airport .

Planners generally use bollards or cement piers to keep possible bomb-laden cars at least 20 feet to 30 feet from a building 's support beams , said Dick Marchi , a senior adviser with Airports Council International-North America .

' The real fear is that somebody will bring a building down, ' Marchi said .
' Turns out with blast protection , a relatively small distance ( away ) does an awful lot of good. '

Airports have spread out the cost of these upgrades using bond revenue , rent hikes and parking garage money , among other sources of income .
Still , some of the expense filters down in the form of higher prices for a cup of coffee or a parking space .

' The passenger ultimately pays for everything, ' Marchi said .

The Indianapolis terminal is one of the first airports designed and built since September 11 .
Planners more than doubled the space provided for security equipment compared with the current airport .
They added a room for isolating international travelers suspected of carrying a contagious disease .

They also spent $ 24 million to build an inline baggage screening system beneath the terminal 's main floor .
The system includes about a mile of conveyor belts that feed luggage through scanners , which compare bag contents with properties found in explosives .
Security personnel will keep watch from a nearby room , and they 'll be able to quickly divert any suspicious bags .

Since the government now requires all baggage to be checked for explosives , the Transportation Security Administration provided the scanners for Indianapolis .
Previously , only luggage on international flights had to be scanned .

Dallas/Fort Worth plans a similar baggage screening system for its five terminals .
Bell expects to spend about $ 140 million on it by the time it 's finished in 2010 .

Construction started on that airport 's new international terminal shortly before the 2001 attacks .
Planners adjusted their design to add $ 47 million in security upgrades .

They fortified walls with more steel and concrete , and they set up a separate road for deliveries .
Drivers must pass a security checkpoint to get near the terminal .
Shipments are then dropped at a central location and screened before they reach the vendor .

' This is really the trend of the future, ' Bell said .
' Everybody would be basically prearranging this so there would n't be any strange beer truck that comes out of nowhere. '

Airports also hope to boost security by making passengers happier about the checkpoint process .

Indianapolis will use natural light to help improve the mood around its two checkpoints , and it plans to install monitors that tell passengers how long it takes to pass through checkpoints .

The Dallas/Fort Worth airport , meanwhile , plans to use video displays and recorded messages to direct passengers in a less irritating manner .

' In the past , the town crier TSA guy would , every five minutes , look up and start yelling at everybody to take out your liquids, ' Bell said .

Bell also wants to set up parallel tables before the checkpoints so more people can remove their shoes and wallets for scanning .
That will tame checkpoint waits and keep passengers calm , which makes it easier to spot potential problems .

' If everybody 's irritated and cussing, ' Bell said , 'it 's hard to tell who might be a person of interest. '
