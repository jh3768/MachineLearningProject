NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- I spent a few hours looking over video footage and still photos of 40 years ago this weekend , June 1968 .

These photos marked a dramatic moment as 2 million people lined the railroad tracks from New York to Washington .
They came to watch the funeral train carrying the body of Sen. Robert Kennedy , the Democratic presidential candidate who had been assassinated days earlier .

I am so struck by the pictures from that day , because the enduring power of the moment comes not just from the tragedy itself -- but you can see in the faces all the anxieties , fears , frustrations and dreams behind the demand for profound change .

In America in the late '60s , a generation was grappling with an unpopular war and an unpopular president .
The country was impatient ; there were massive pressures for social change .

I am struck with the photos of the millions along the tracks , a spontaneous outpouring of grief , uniting Americans of all races and all ages -- rich and poor alike .

There are shots of people waving , crying , saluting or just staring .
In their way , people wanted to be a part of it .
They wanted to say goodbye .

Fast-forward 40 years , and there are so many parallels : an unpopular president , an unpopular war that many are calling 'unwinnable .
' America is filled with anxiety and impatience , yet a new generation is energized .

I get the sense we 've reached a turning point , with an election that could change the world .

Kennedy changed the world 40 years ago by going into African-American homes and poor neighborhoods that politicians told him were 'not worth it .
' Now , 40 years later , Kennedy 's party has picked an African-American to be its leader .

African-American homes we visited this week look back at 1968 , the year the Rev .
Martin Luther King Jr. also was assassinated , and people say they have 'reached the promised land ' that King described in a speech he gave the night before he was slain that April .

In 1968 , the women 's liberation movement was in its nascent stages .
Now , dozens of women are in Congress , and Sen. Hillary Clinton has broken through many barriers to become a major candidate for president of the United States .

Certainly my own career path would have been filled with many more obstacles without the relentless efforts of so many women during that era and still of others today .
