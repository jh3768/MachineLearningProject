Commentary: Obama summons ghosts of American history - CNN.com
Editor 's note : Paul Begala , a Democratic strategist and CNN political contributor , was a political consultant for Bill Clinton 's presidential campaign in 1992 and was counselor to Clinton in the White House .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Sometimes pictures tell a story better than words .
On Inauguration Day , we saw Barack Obama , strong and certain , striding purposefully into the presidency .

And we saw Dick Cheney , once one of the most powerful people on Earth , reduced to being wheeled out of the White House .

Of course , we all wish good health for the former vice president , but the contrasting images were stark .

Barack Obama 's inaugural address was a bracing , brave break with the past .

' On this day, ' he said , 'we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises , the recriminations and worn-out dogmas that for far too long have strangled our politics .
' He sternly scolded the 'greed and irresponsibility ' of our current era , and called for 'action , bold and swift. '

Take that , George W. Bush , whose false promises and worn-out dogmas have turned so much of the nation against him .

Barack Obama 's story is unique in its particulars , but it is universal in its appeal .
One grandfather a Kenyan goat herder who opposed colonial rule , the other a Kansas farm boy who joined Patton 's army to fight the Nazis .

His parents ' marriage was illegal in 16 states , and his mother struggled , turning to food stamps to keep body and soul together , and waking young Barry up at 4 : 30 in the morning to nourish his brain .

He understands and appreciates the American Dream because he is its living embodiment .
His story is our story .
And now his fate and ours are inextricably intertwined .

As a speechwriter , I know you say a lot in the quotations you choose .
President Barack Obama chose two and he chose wisely .
First , St. Paul 's letter to the Corinthians in which he exhorts the people of Corinth to , in effect , grow up .

' When I was a child, ' Paul wrote , 'I spoke like a child , I thought like a child , and reasoned like a child .
But when I became a man I put aside childish things. '

The new president used that ancient letter to deliver a badly needed message after eight years of anything goes : Put your big-boy pants on , America .

The president closed by quoting the words from Tom Paine that Gen. Washington ordered read aloud at Valley Forge .
' Let it be told to the future world, ' Washington said , 'that in the depth of winter , when nothing but hope and virtue could survive... that the city and the country , alarmed at one common danger , came forth to meet [ it ] . '

The quote shows Obama 's belief in unflinching courage , unblinking realism and an unrelenting faith that by coming together we Americans can bend history to our will .

Of course , even as Washington words echoed , other ghosts of American history were milling about .
Abe Lincoln prowled the Mall .
FDR , his ever-present cigarette holder clenched in his smiling teeth , cheered zestily .
Dr. King called out from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial , and John F. Kennedy called back to him from the steps of the Capitol .

When Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his 'I Have a Dream ' speech in 1963 , President Kennedy watched it on TV from the White House .
As King concluded , Kennedy said , 'He 's good .
He 's damn good .
' I like to think that as Barack Obama concluded his inaugural address , Dr. King turned to President Kennedy and said , 'This young man 's pretty damn good , too. '
