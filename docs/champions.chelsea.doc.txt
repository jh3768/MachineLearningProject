Coach Hiddink promises Chelsea passion - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- Guus Hiddink promises a performance full of 'energy and passion ' on his home 'debut ' as Chelsea coach against Juventus in the Champions League on Wednesday .

Russian national coach Hiddink agreed to additionally take charge of stuttering Chelsea until the end of the campaign -- and he started with a win at Premier League rivals Aston Villa .

Hiddink admits he is racing against the clock to ensure his coaching methods bring some tangible reward as Chelsea bid for glory in Europe and the FA Cup , and also ensure Champions League action next campaign .

Chelsea face the second-placed Serie A side,managed by former Blues boss Claudio Ranieri in the first leg of their last-16 tie and Hiddink will not accept the lack of preparation time as an excuse for failure .

' I should have two , three or four weeks to observe the team and everything , and then I 'd start working, ' he told PA Sport .

' But there 's no time .
That 's not an aspect of top-level sport , to offer excuses .
It has to be done in the moment against Villa and what we have now , home and away , against Juventus .

' Every manager would like four , five or six weeks to implement a lot of things .
But I have to do that in a reduced time , a pressured time .
But we have to do it .

' I 'd like to underline , we must not give ourselves an excuse because , if we do , there 's a tendency that we go a little bit less and that 's not good in the boys ' minds. '

Hiddink took PSV Eindhoven to victory in the final of the European Cup in 1988 and later to the last four of the Champions League in 2005 .

But he is relishing the new challenge of European football with Chelsea .

' You are among the elite clubs if you 're still in the Champions League after the winter, ' said Hiddink .
' That 's where a club like this needs to be .
It 's a very exciting competition for all of us .

' Being in charge for the first time is special .
We had a good first game at Villa , so that takes away a little bit of the first excitement .

' But being in this competition with this home crowd , I think everyone can expect a lot from the team in the way of energy and passion. '

But he admitted Ranieri will not make it easy for his former club .

' He 's ( Ranieri ) a gentleman coach, ' said Hiddink .
' He 's very intelligent .
Modest is maybe not the word , but he knows how to cope with the press and the pressure in this particular job .
I respect him very much .

' He has several abilities .
When he was working here , he made a team that was very competitive for the Premier League .

' Secondly , recently , he 's very good at organising his team .
His teams show themselves to have enormous tactical discipline .
It 's very difficult to play those teams that he is managing. '

Rafael van der Vaart has been recalled to the Real Madrid squad for their last-16 first leg against Liverpool at the Bernabeu .

The Dutch playmaker is the only addition to the 18-man squad that thrashed Real Betis 6-1 in the Primera Liga at the weekend , with Van der Vaart 's compatriot Klaas Jan Huntelaar the man to drop out .

Huntelaar , who scored twice against Betis , is ineligible to play in the Champions League as Madrid were only able to register one of their two winter signings who had already appeared in European action this season .

The former Ajax man missed out in favor of ex-Portsmouth midfielder Lassana Diarra .

Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez included Steven Gerrard in his 20-man squad , but has yet to decide whether or not to risk him following hamstring trouble .

' Steven was not fit to face Manchester City on Sunday , but we will now wait to see how he does in two training sessions before making a decision about this game, ' said Benitez .

' It will not be a gamble .
If the doctor says he is okay , then it is not a risk .
Steven is more mature now , he would not make a decision that would be considered a risk .

' He will be involved in light training sessions , we will not try to hide anything .
We will make a decision when we are sure .

' Gerrard knows he must give something to the team , and if he can not do that he will know he is not ready .
I can trust Steven on that. '

Bayern Munich go to Sporting Lisbon and Villarreal are at home to Panathinaikos in Wednesday 's other Champions League action .
