Borger: Time for Obama to be The Decider - CNN.com
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- So far in this new presidency , there 's been a lot of what we in Washington call 'outreach .
' As in : outreach to labor , outreach to governors and , most of all , outreach to Republicans .

In fact , President Obama is spending so much time reaching out on Capitol Hill , it almost looks like he 's still in the Senate .

Even so , it 's probably immensely meaningful , in a Washington sort of way , that Obama has traveled up Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol to call on the GOP , again and again .
After all , members of Congress just love to be flattered .

But after all of the jawboning and all of the spending concessions , including the removal of money for some social programs of questionable 'stimulative ' value , Obama still found himself with no Republican votes for his economic package when it passed the House .

Not to worry , says one sanguine White House adviser .
' It 's just as important that we are conducting ourselves differently. '

Not quite .

Obama may have great tone and touch , but the Republicans are winning the spin wars -- at least this round .
Not because the public agrees with conservatives who want more tax cuts .
It 's because the public wants spending -- only they expect it to work .

Unlike some of those House Democrats , most folks are n't focusing on using the package as a way to re-engineer social policy .
They want to create more jobs to fix the problem at hand .
And they would like Congress to at least try to agree on some big ways to do it .

Here 's the problem for Obama : He has issued an important promissory note to the American people .
He said he would work with -- and win the support of -- Republicans ; that he will be bipartisan .
He ca n't afford to lose all of them out of the box .

Sure , there are some Republicans whose ideological blinders will never allow them to vote with Obama .
But there may be about 30 in the House and another dozen in the Senate he can win over .

But here 's the rub : He 's going to have to choose which side he is on .
He 's got to decide between the more liberal spending plan endorsed by House Democrats , or a plan bound to be much smaller on the spending side in the Senate .
And it 's not just about numbers ; it 's about what he and his economic team believe will work , and will work the fastest .

That 's going to mean saying 'no ' to some in his own party .
In fact , you might argue that , in his polite way , Obama gave too much power to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi at the outset -- allowing eight years of pent-up Democratic demand for spending to show up ( in one way or another ) in this stimulus bill .
After all , after years of living in a pay-as-you-go budget world , spending with abandon clearly had its attractions .

But some of the spending also gave Republicans the opportunity to claim that Democrats were trying to restore their political priorities , and not just jobs , which is exactly what they were doing .

So the House Democrats had to take out money for contraceptives .
And Senate Democrats decided to drop two controversial spending programs , including $ 75 million for anti-smoking programs and $ 400 million for HIV prevention .
All laudable .
But not now , not in this bill .

Now Obama will be left trying to use the Senate version of the stimulus package as a hammer against the House .
And , no doubt about it , Democratic senators will proceed differently , largely because the Senate itself is a more center-seeking institution than the House .
Moderate Democrats like Montana 's Jon Tester or Virginia 's Jim Webb wo n't march in the House direction ; moderate Republicans like Maine Sens .
Susan Collins or Olympia Snowe wo n't think tax cuts are enough to get the economy moving again .

In the end , Obama does n't want to start off like President Bill Clinton in 1993 .

Clinton 's first deficit reduction package -- arguably the most important legislation of his presidency -- was passed without any Republican votes .
It set the strident and partisan tone for the next four years .

That 's not what Obama has in mind .
