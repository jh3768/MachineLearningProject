Dinosaur mummy holds many secrets - CNN.com
BISMARCK , North Dakota ( AP ) -- Parts of a rare mummified dinosaur that has attracted worldwide interest went on display in North Dakota 's state museum .

People from across the country and even England gathered Saturday at the Heritage Center on the state Capitol grounds for the unveiling .

' It is a fascinating fossil , and it 's one which we 're going to be disinterring secrets from ... for many years to come, ' said Phillip Manning , a paleontologist at Manchester University in England and a member of the international team of more than 50 researchers working on the project .

In a back room of the museum , a much larger chunk of the prehistoric relic waits for workers with tiny brushes and chisels to free it from its rock tomb -- if they can find the money to do it .

The Edmontosaurus named Dakota , a duckbilled dinosaur covered by fossilized skin , lay beneath the western North Dakota soil for about 67 million years before being unearthed between 2004 and 2006 .
It is among just a few mummified dinosaurs in the world , and researchers working on it say it might be the best in terms of quality and quantity of preserved skin .

Animal tissue typically decomposes quickly after death and most dinosaur fossils are only bone .
Researchers say Dakota must have been buried rapidly and in just the right environment for its skin and soft tissues to be replaced by minerals and preserved .

' When you see the final product of the science , it will be something which will be founded in fact and not in just animation and many of the things you see on the television, ' Manning said .

An arm and tail that workers chipped out of sandstone casing were unveiled at the Heritage Center on Saturday .

' It 's certainly drawing a lot of attention to North Dakota, ' state paleontologist John Hoganson , with the North Dakota Geological Survey , said in an interview .
' We know people are going to be coming in from all over the country and world to see this. '

Hoganson said he has had calls from interested people from England to Australia .

Most of the Edmontosaurus skeleton remains in what researchers refer to as the 'body block .
' The block was examined earlier in the world 's largest CT scanner , operated by the Boeing Co. in California and used to examine space shuttle parts .
Researchers still are not yet sure what all it contains , including whether it contains the dinosaur 's head .

' It was such a huge file , it has n't been totally analyzed, ' Hoganson said .
' Everybody feels it 's a pretty complete skeleton .
' Still , a head is 'a pretty big question mark, ' he said .

' It is hard to say how much more money is needed to finish the preparation , but it is likely around $ 100,000, ' said Tyler Lyson , a doctoral paleontology student at Yale University who discovered the dinosaur on his uncle 's ranch in the North Dakota Badlands in 1999 .

The National Geographic Society , which has funded most of the research so far , spending about $ 200,000 , is considering more funding , said spokeswoman Barbara Moffet .
' You can safely say it has been one of National Geographic 's most significant scientific research investments in recent years, ' she said in an interview .

Moffet told the crowd at the Heritage Center that National Geographic has funded more than 9,000 research projects .
' We 've seen a lot of dinosaurs come and go , but we 've got to say ... Dakota is like none we 've ever seen before, ' she said .

Hoganson estimated that enough money remains for about three more months of work .
He said the hope is to get more funding from National Geographic , but that if no new money is found , he may look for volunteers to work on the mummy .

Stephen Begin , a Michigan consultant on the project who helped meticulously remove the arm and tail from their rock casing , said he thinks it will take 'substantially more ' money to complete the project than initially thought , though he did not venture a guess as to how much .

He said work on removing the rock around Dakota 's body will take at least a year and maybe longer .

' As they get into the body block , there is less skin exposed and places where it 's not exposed, ' he said in a telephone interview .
' You do n't know if there 's skin there or not , so you have to go slow on the assumption there might be .

' You 'd rather be safe than , 'oops , I did n't think there would be skin there but there was and I just whacked off a whole bunch,' ' said Begin , who estimated he has invested 1,000 hours in the Dakota project .

Lyson 's uncle has donated the Dakota fossil to the research foundation started by his nephew , who hopes to eventually send the relic on a worldwide tour and then bring it back to his hometown of Marmarth , in North Dakota 's southwestern corner , where he is creating a museum .
Lyson said the first stop on the world tour is likely to be Japan , sometime next year .
