America's need for oil like an 'addiction,' expert says - CNN.com
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- You 've no doubt heard the language by now -- that Americans are plagued by an oil addiction .

In his 2006 State of the Union address , President Bush used the analogy while pushing for more research into alternative energy sources , saying , 'here we have a serious problem .
America is addicted to oil. '

But is U.S. dependence on oil a true 'addiction ' ?

Jack Henningfield , an adjunct professor at Johns Hopkins University who has extensively studied addictions , said there are parallels .

' Oil addiction is not an addiction in the medical sense , like a drug addiction or a tobacco addiction, ' Henningfield said .
' But it is an addiction in the sense that powerful behaviors are involved .
They 're difficult to change , [ and ] it can be agonizing for people to change. '

Henningfield said that when it comes to substance addiction , the brain rewires itself to depend on the chemical .

Similarly , in the case of oil , Henningfield noted , 'our nation has been rewired .
Our national infrastructure has been wired by cheap plentiful oil. '

So , how does Bush 's proposal for more oil drilling offshore and in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge fit in to the science of addiction ?

Without commenting on the effectiveness of that proposal , Henningfield said the idea behind it can be compared to a smoker using a nicotine patch .

' We have to give people ... some kind of aid to just function and just get along, ' Henningfield said .

He added , however , that while studies show that aids such as the nicotine patch can help people function in the short term , as part of an effective long-term solution , additional drilling 'may do little to actually help people in the short or long term to the oil addiction problem ' and 'could actually divert attention away from long-term solutions. '

Democrats argue that Bush 's proposal would only enable America 's oil addiction .

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D-California , said recently , 'Foreign oil , the president said we were addicted to it .
And what does he want to do ?
He wants to reinforce the addiction. '

Pelosi has said she will not schedule votes in the House of Representatives to lift the bans on offshore drilling and oil exploration in ANWR .

Henningfield said that 's why any strategy to break an addiction must have a long-term goal .
Ultimately , he said , kicking any habit can boil down to economics , as smoking studies have shown .

' Money talks for addictions .
Money gets people 's attention .
And the most important single driver to get people to quit smoking is the rising cost of cigarettes, ' Henningfield said .
' So , with addictions -- whether it 's cocaine , nicotine or oil -- money talks. '
