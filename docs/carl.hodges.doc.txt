Frontline pioneer: Carl Hodges - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- Dr. Carl N. Hodges is turning the tide on sea-level rise and revolutionizing agriculture in the process .

As the founder and chairman of The Seawater Foundation , Dr. Hodges is convinced that by following nature 's example , it is possible to prevent climate change induced sea-level rises .
With a background in atmospheric physics and mathematics , Dr. Hodges has developed an integrated agricultural and aquacultural farm in Africa -- with a second one in Mexico -- which uses salty seawater to green the desert .

Rather than using seawater for desalination -- which requires great energy consumption -- Dr. Hodges proposes that seawater can be drawn inland to irrigate seawater-tolerant crops and plants , creating arable land , food and employment in areas once thought too dry to sustain life .

Dr. Hodges ' math shows that if seawater-irrigated agriculture developed at the same rate as traditional agriculture did from 1930 to 2003 , sea-level rise could be stopped in less than 15 years .

Apart from his achievements with The Seawater Foundation , Dr. Hodges has worked in partnership with major corporations including The Coca-Cola Company , Monsanto and Walt Disney Imagineering .
He is also a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and a Fellow of the World Academy of Art and Science .

This celebrated scientist and innovator might just have the solution to two of the world 's critical problems : sea-level rise and famine .
