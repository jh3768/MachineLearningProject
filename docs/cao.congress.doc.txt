Attorney hopes to become first Vietnamese in Congress - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- Anh 'Joseph ' Cao is hoping an election Saturday will make him the first Vietnamese-American to be elected to Congress .

The 41-year-old Cao ( pronounced Gow ) is running in Louisiana 's 2nd Congressional District , which contains most of the city of New Orleans , against the indicted incumbent Democrat , Rep. William Jefferson .

Cao 's main appeal is that he is a Republican alternative to the controversial Jefferson .

Jefferson , who has held the seat since 1991 , is awaiting trial for allegedly stashing $ 90,000 in bribe money in his freezer .
But so far , those allegations have n't kept Jefferson from seeking another term , or getting the most votes in last month 's Democratic primary .

Cao , an immigration attorney who 's married and has two daughters , is keenly aware of the fact that he was virtually unknown before this campaign began and has never held public office before .

His only previous political experience was running for the Louisiana State Assembly in 2007 as an independent .
He lost .
But these limitations have n't handicapped him from raising around $ 200,000 in campaign contributions during this election .

State Republicans feel Jefferson 's legal troubles may provide their best opportunity to win his seat , and the Republican National Congressional Committee is providing an additional $ 42,000 to help before the election Saturday .

Much of that money will be used to energize election-weary voters to get out and vote .

Silas Lee , a political analyst in New Orleans , says that getting core supporters to the polls will be key to who wins .
In September , Hurricane Gustav postponed the process , causing the election to be delayed until Saturday .

Jefferson , who is black , still enjoys significant support in the second district , which is heavily African-American and Democratic .
But Cao believes the time is right for him to reach across racial and political divides for the betterment of the district .

' Jefferson has a large core of voters, ' Cao says , and 'the biggest challenges are to convince that core of voters that the best thing for Louisiana , for the district , is to have them vote against the person that they have supported for a very long time. '

Lee says Cao 's biggest advantage simply may be that he is not Jefferson .
He says Cao needs to keep telling voters that 'I am not William Jefferson .
I will not embarrass this district. '

Running up to the election , Cao supporters stood with signs on New Orleans ' St. Charles Avenue as the area 's famous streetcars hauled hurried workers through the morning rush hour .
Drivers , mostly white and middle class , honked their horns and gave thumbs-up in support .

Cao claims to have made inroads with many disgruntled Democrats who can no longer support Jefferson , and has spent a lot of time talking with African-American church groups , trying to convince them that he will best serve them in the ongoing rebuilding of New Orleans .

Cao says he is concerned the people of the district are not getting the help they need .
Jefferson 'is more consumed with fighting his legal troubles than he is with helping the people of his district, ' he says .

Cao says he understands the 'melting pot ' nature of his adopted state .

He came to the United states in 1975 at the age of 8 along with an older sister and younger brother .
His parents and five other siblings had to stay behind in Vietnam as it fell to the communists .

His father , who was an officer in the South Vietnamese army , spent seven years in a communist prison .
It was n't until 1991 that his family was reunited in the United States .

Cao says that it is important to have a Vietnamese-American in Congress to be a voice for the 1.5 million Vietnamese in the United States , and that his experience as an immigration attorney can bring a needed insight to the hotly debated issue of immigration .

He says he considers himself a moderate , fiscally conservative Republican .
Cao says there is Asian tradition to be frugal , but he is more moderate when it comes to issues like immigration and gay rights , although he does not support same-sex marriage .

With the election of Louisiana 's Bobby Jindal , the country 's first Indian-American governor , Cao believes the state has come a long way in dispelling the racial stereotypes long associated with it .

' We can finally get away from the image of David Duke and some of the other politicians that gave Louisiana a bad name, ' he said .

He says that in this tight race , he has confidence in the people of the second district .

' A large portion of the community is able to look beyond whether one is black or white , or Asian , to vote for a person they believe will best represent the district. '
