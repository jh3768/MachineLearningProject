'Flightseeing': Experience the world from on high - CNN.com
( Travel + Leisure ) -- The hum of the single-engine Cessna fills your ears as you ascend above the Peruvian high desert .
Below you , flat expanses of dry , brown earth extend in every direction , punctuated only by twisting dry riverbeds ... a lifeless landscape .
Then the plane banks , and over the intercom the pilot directs you to look at what appear to be just another set of curving , squiggly lines .

But then , as you watch , the lines start to come to life , to form a definitive shape , with a spread-finned tail at one end , a gaping mouth at the other , and an eye in the middle , staring up at you : it 's a giant line drawing of a whale , carved right into the landscape .

An aerial tour is the only way to fully appreciate Peru 's mysterious geoglyphs , known as the Nazca lines ; the 2,000-year-old depictions of animals and geometric figures can be miles long -- much too immense to be seen from the ground .
But though these earth-etchings are some of the most dramatic sights you 'll ever see from the air , there 's plenty of other scenery around the world best viewed from on high .

Most anyone who 's spent an hour playing with Google Earth already knows the fascination of observing places from above .
When seen from a bird 's-eye perspective , even familiar land- and cityscapes become completely new , with colors , patterns , and geographical features you 'd never known existed until you hovered above them .

So it makes sense that aerial tours -- otherwise known as 'flightseeing ' trips --have become more popular and more specialized over the past few years .
Many operators , such as the Wasilla-based Sky Trekking Alaska , have broadened their offerings considerably as customer enthusiasm has grown .

' The interest in seeing Alaska from the air has now evolved into trips that ... include camping in national parks , visiting remote native villages , and enjoying bed and breakfast accommodations ' over multiday flights , says Sky Trekking Alaska spokesperson Heather R. S. Oberholtzer .
Most recently , the outfit has started offering Iditarod flight tours , which allow guests to track the famous dogsled race from above .

Today 's aerial tours run the gamut -- taking in all kinds of scenery from a variety of airborne vehicles .
Flightseeing enthusiasts can choose to take in spectacular landscapes -- like the Grand Canyon or New England hillsides carpeted in fall foliage -- via biplane or single-engine craft ; they can also check out wildlife -- like New Zealand whales or Tanzanian zebra herds -- via helicopter or hot-air balloon .
They can even hover above hectic cityscapes -- like Tokyo 's famous neon-studded skyscrapers -- in a zeppelin .

Planning ahead is important when booking an aerial tour .
Some seasonal conditions -- like winter snowfall and autumn 's changing leaves -- are no-brainers , but there are other things to take into consideration too .
Some regions have their own specific meteorological issues -- like the dust that tends to hang in the air during the midday heat in the Nazca Desert , or the mini-monsoons that hit almost every summer afternoon in Australia 's tropical Whitsunday Islands .

Flightseeing trips that involve wildlife viewing can be harder to predict ; they often involve flying over the right place at the right time .
But since there are some animal routines that are well established -- like the migration of wildebeest herds across the Serengeti every summer and fall , and the feeding patterns of sperm whales off New Zealand 's Kaikoura coast -- it 's wise to talk to a tour operator about the best times to fly .

John MacPhail of Wings Over Whales , an aerial whale-watching tour based in Kaikoura , confirms this .
Though 'it 's not possible to predict when certain kinds of whales will be around, ' MacPhail says -- referring to blues , fins , humpbacks , and orcas -- 'sperm whales feed here all year round .
' So , even on a not especially lucky sighting day , his tour participants almost always go home with full camera memory cards -- and wonderful memories .
