Experts weigh in on which vitamins to toss back or toss out - CNN.com
ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) -- Americans love to take their vitamins .
More than 150 million Americans take dietary supplements according to the Council for Responsible Nutrition , a supplement industry trade group .

But what should you do ?
Walk through the vitamin aisle of any grocery store , and you 're hit by a staggering array of options .
From vitamin A to glucosamine to milk thistle ( what is that , anyway ?
) to whey protein , it 's hard to decide what to take .

That 's why this week the Empowered Patient asked four experts -- all medical doctors -- what supplements they take every day .
Their lists may surprise you -- they all take at least two supplements -- some take three or four or more .

Choosing a daily vitamin regimen is especially daunting in light of two new studies out this week .
In the largest and longest study of its kind , researchers at Brigham and Women 's Hospital in Boston , Massachusetts , found that vitamins C and E do nothing to protect against heart disease in men .
The study , published in The Journal of the American Medical Association , also found that vitamin E even appeared to raise the risk of bleeding strokes , which , while rare , are often the most deadly .
Other research on women and vitamins is also discouraging .

A study in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute this week found that a daily regimen of vitamin D and calcium did not offer any protection against invasive breast cancer .

With those studies in mind , here 's what our panel of experts takes every day .

Dr. Andrew Weil ; Age : 66 ; director , Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine ; Drweil.com

What he takes :

A daily multivitamin/multimineral

Vitamin D. Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to breast cancer , colon cancer , prostate cancer , heart disease , and multiple sclerosis , as well as other conditions .
Studies show many of us are vitamin D deficient .
Weil says look on the label to make sure you 're getting vitamin D3 , not vitamin D2 .

Magnesium. Lack of magnesium may lead to irritablity , muscle weakness , and irregular heartbeat .

Juvenon ( or 'Omega ' ) , a compound believed to enhance cellular health and function .
This supplement contains two nutrients , acetyl-L-carnitine and alpha lipoic acid .
The company that makes Juvenon says benefits include 'more energy, ' a 'sharper mind ' , and 'more restful sleep. '

Co-Q-10 , a supplement that boosts coenzyme Q10 , which is produced by the human body and is necessary for the basic functioning of cells .
Animal studies have found that coenzyme Q10 helps the immune system work better and makes the body better able to resist certain infections and types of cancer .

Weil , author of 10 books including , 'Eight Weeks to Optimum Health, ' says it is important to take studies , like the one in JAMA , with a grain of salt .
' I believe vitamins E and C are important as part of our antioxidant defenses , even if we have not yet documented specific preventive effects, ' says Weil .

What not to take

Weil says men should n't take iron unless they 've been diagnosed by a physician as having iron deficiency anemia .
He also advises against men taking calcium supplements ; he 's concerned they could increase the risk of prostate cancer .

Dr. Christiane Northrup ; Age : '50 something ; ' author , 'The Secret Pleasures of Menopause ; ' Drnorthrup.com

What she takes :

Antioxidant supplement

Fish oil .
Some studies have found fish oil , which contains omega 3 fatty acids , can help lower triglyceride levels , lower blood pressure , and help depression , among other uses .

Calcium , which can help prevent osteoporosis -- a problem in particular for older women

Magnesium

Coenzyme Q10

Vitamin D

Northrup , an authority on women 's health and wellness and author of the new book 'The Secret Pleasures of Menopause, ' says it is important to remember that vitamins are not drugs .
They do n't work the same way in the body .

' Vitamins are best taken in the correct proportions to each other, ' says Northrup .
For example , she says if you are taking folic acid , which is a B vitamin , you 'll do better when you also take the other Bs that make up the B complex .
Says Northrup , 'That 's how nutrients occur naturally and how the body best utilizes them. '

What not to take

Northrup says postmenopausal women almost never need iron , and taking too much might pose a risk for heart health .

Dr. Walter Willett ; Age : 63 ; chairman , Department of Nutrition , Harvard School of Public Health

What he takes :

Multivitamin

Vitamin D

Willett thinks the jury is still out on vitamin E and C and heart health .
' I do n't think we have the final answer, ' says Willett , the chair of the Department of Nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health .
He points out that in the Women 's Health Study , women receiving vitamin E experienced a statistically significant 24 percent reduction in total cardiovascular disease mortality .

What not to take

He agrees with Dr. Weil : men do n't need extra calcium , and high intake might increase the risk of prostate cancer .

Dr. Melina Jampolis ; Age : 38 ; Drmelina.com

What she takes :

Multivitamin

Calcium

Vitamin D

Omega 3

Jampolis , who practices in San Francisco , California , and specializes exclusively in nutrition for weight loss and disease prevention and treatment , says everyone should take a basic multivitamin .
' I like to call it an insurance policy, ' she says .

What not to take

What not to take : 'I 'm not convinced that the 'beautiful skin ' vitamins really help much -- it 's much better to get the nutrients from your diet , drink water , and wear sunscreen, ' Jampolis says .

The bottom line

Our experts agree you should n't make decisions about what vitamins to take based on a single study .
For example , the JAMA study findings did n't make our experts lose faith in these two vitamins .

' I believe vitamins E and C are important for optimum health as part of our antioxidant defenses , even if we have not yet documented specific preventive effects, ' Weil says .

The experts also agree that taking vitamins is only part of the larger puzzle .
You also need to watch your diet and exercise .
And , do your homework .
New studies come out all the time .
