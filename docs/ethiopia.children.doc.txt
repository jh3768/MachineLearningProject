Food costs strain efforts to save starving Ethiopian children - CNN.com
EGU VILLAGE , Ethiopia ( CNN ) -- A year of drought and soaring food prices has threatened the lives of tens of thousands of Ethiopian children .

' We have nothing to feed our children, ' said Egu 's village elder .
' We are losing our children day by day. '

Ethiopia 's Health Ministry , along with UNICEF , monitors the health of thousands of children here , but the number of areas they have been able to regularly visit has been cut in half this year .

The small rains that normally allow Ethiopian farmers to plant a second crop each year did not come this year , adding to a critical food shortage .

' It 's an open crisis , and there are more people than we expected , than the government expected , who need additional food, ' said Bjorn Ljungqvist , head of UNICEF Ethiopia .

There is a crucial shortfall in the supply of therapeutic foods used to treat children with severe acute malnutrition , the UNICEF official said .

The U.N. 's children 's agency is appealing for $ 50 million to pay for emergency needs .

UNICEF estimates that 6 million Ethiopian children under the age of 5 are at risk and that more than 120,000 have only about a month to live .

The World Food Program supplies the emergency food for UNICEF , but rising food prices mean it could not guarantee aid for all the areas in need .

' Unless you get immediate assistance the risk is , you fall into severe malnutrition and eventually death , so unless our supporters come in immediately for this , we fear that is what is going to happen in the country, ' said Jakob Mikkelse , the program 's nutrition and education chief .

Egu is a village UNICEF is no longer able to visit regularly .

' If we were not here , those children who we had found now with severe acute malnutrition would have died at home, ' UNICEF Emergency Nutrition Project Officer Samson Dessie said .

As the relief workers depart Egu , they leave behind a few emergency food packs and a promise to return .

The Ethiopian government has worked with UNICEF since 2004 on the Enhanced Outreach Strategy to provide food for child survival .
The effort distributes child survival packages that include vitamin A supplementation , de-worming , measles catch-up , nutritional screening and referral to supplementary or therapeutic feeding programs .

' EOS is really very important from many perspectives with regard to child survival, ' Dessie said .
' The first is it brings high-impact , low-cost child survival packages like vitamin A , which can reduce child mortality by up to 35 percent. '
