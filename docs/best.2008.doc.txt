Review: The best (and worst) films of 2008 - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- Looking back , I find I 've written more than 350 film reviews over the past 12 months .
That 's a lot of time sitting in the dark , especially when you 're challenged to whittle them all down to the best 20 hours or so for the annual top 10 list .

You surely do n't need me to tell you this has n't been a vintage year .
Even so , there are no shortage of films I 'm glad to have seen and would be quick to recommend .

Many of them -- most , even -- have not had the benefit of huge marketing machines , free media hype or long bookings in the multiplexes .
And this maybe one area where the critic does have a useful role to play : getting the word out .

For example , Juan Antonio Bayona 's fine Spanish horror movie 'The Orphanage ' was the kind of movie you could easily miss .
A classical ghost story on the face of it , it gradually revealed hidden depths , an acute sense of grief and loss and -- who would have thought it ?
-- a subtle , wrenching spin on 'Peter Pan. '

If not for the critics , would Danny Boyle 's exuberant Oscar front-runner 'Slumdog Millionaire ' have stood a chance of making its mark ?
Or such imaginative non-fiction films as the ( literally ) suspenseful 'Man on Wire, ' the all-too-timely , animated 'Waltz with Bashir ' and Guy Maddin 's dolorous memoir 'My Winnipeg ' ( notable for a last appearance by the great femme fatale Ann Savage , who died just last week ) ?

This year , for whatever reason , much of the most exciting work has come out of left field .
An obvious example would be the year 's two Gus Van Sant movies .
The big-budget biopic 'Milk ' has obvious Oscar potential : It 's a true story about an inspiring character who tied himself to a cause and paid the highest price for it .

' Milk ' is a fine film , with outstanding performances from Sean Penn , Josh Brolin and James Franco .
Perhaps it is also 'important ' in the ongoing struggle against discrimination .
But if you put it beside Van Sant 's independently made portrait of a mixed-up Portland , Oregon , teenager , 'Paranoid Park, ' it 's obvious which project truly engaged him as an artist .
The latter is a complex creative response to the world and the difficulty of negotiating our own space within it .

It 's too bad that a good many of the more groundbreaking films have scarcely been seen outside of festivals and a few cosmopolitan art houses : Jose Luis Guerin 's dazzling 'In the City of Sylvia, ' for instance , or the ecstatic Indonesian musical 'Opera Jawa ' or Lance Hammer 's soulful U.S. indie , 'Ballast .
' I doubt there has been a more perceptive movie about relationships this year than Hong Sang-soo 's 'Woman on the Beach ' or a more inspired cop thriller than Johnnie To 's lunatic Hong Kong mystery , 'Mad Detective .
' ( Movie fans , I hope you add these to your Netflix queues .
) What do you think of all these lists ?

You can believe Anne Hathaway gives the best performance by an actress this year in 'Rachel Getting Married ' if you want to , but you should also see Juliette Binoche in 'The Flight of the Red Balloon, ' Emmanuelle Devos in 'A Christmas Story, ' Michelle Williams in 'Wendy and Lucy ' or even veteran opera singer Galina Vishevskaya in 'Alexandra .
' Many good films -- too many -- are under the radar nowadays .

All that said , I 'd go to the mat for Mickey Rourke as Randy the Ram in Darren Aronofsky 's 'The Wrestler, ' surely the most heartening and unexpected comeback of the year , in a film with intriguing ideas of its own about the elusive boundaries between performing and being .

It was genuinely refreshing to see Robert Downey Jr. on such a high in 'Iron Man ' and sending up his own vocation so mercilessly in 'Tropic Thunder .
' And I 'll stand by my prediction from July that Heath Ledger will win a posthumous Oscar for his astonishing performance as the Joker in 'The Dark Knight ' and deserve it , too .
More than enough has been written about Christopher Nolan 's morbid magnum opus , but Ledger 's mesmerizing tour de force will withstand all the praise -- and the backlash .

Even so , as the dust settles , of all the summer blockbusters I know the two I 'll watch again with unalloyed pleasure are Guillermo Del Toro 's underrated , idiosyncratic 'Hellboy II : The Golden Army, ' and Andrew Stanton 's enchanting , universally praised movie about an amorous trash compactor .
Maybe it 's a sentimental choice , but for me , 'WALL-E ' was easily the outstanding movie of the year .

So , the list :

'WALL-E ' Yes , the second half is merely really , really good , but the nearly wordless first 40 minutes suggests unsuspected affinities between Charlie Chaplin and Stanley Kubrick .

' Encounters at the End of the World ' The documentary of the year also has an apocalyptic theme .
Werner Herzog visits Antarctica and discovers we 're all on thin ice .

' In the City of Sylvia ' A man returns to the city to find the girl that got away .
Jose Luis Guerin fashions a remarkable mazy quasi-musical out of looks and glances .

' Still Life ' Maybe the most prescient film of the year , Jia Zhangke looks at China as a superpower in the making -- and the unmaking -- as the towns along the Three Gorges Dam project are dismantled brick by brick .

' Appaloosa ' Ed Harris was obviously born to make Westerns .
Too unpretentious for its own good , this was classical American moviemaking at its best -- better , incidentally , than Clint Eastwood 's revisionist riff on gun lore in 'Gran Torino. '

' The Wrestler ' Darren Aronofsky 's authentically downbeat movie is distinguished by its sympathy for the muscle men and strippers who never got beyond the first rung of the American Dream .

' Let the Right One In ' Preteen vampires .
This is what 'Twilight ' would be if it were five times better , Swedish and told from the point of view of a lonely 12-year-old boy .

' Paranoid Park ' This poetic teen art film is the most fluent and coherent of Gus Van Sant 's experimental works .
Part crime mystery , part coming-of-age story , it 's positively overflowing with burnished imagery and adolescent turmoil .

' The Curious Case of Benjamin Button ' We know there are no second acts to American lives , but Benjamin takes Fitzgerald at his word .
Brad Pitt ages with uncommon grace in David Fincher 's fantastical love story , the ultimate slow dissolve .

' JCVD ' Jean Claude Van Damme -- the Muscles from Brussels -- pulls a Mickey Rourke , playing himself ( brilliantly ) in a Belgian bank robbery thriller written and directed by first timer Mabrouk El Mechri .
What late nights were invented for .

And the worst .. .

Then there are those films that make you lament losing two hours of your life , even if you have a job to do .
These are listed in reverse order , from ( relatively ) least-worst to the most egregious offender of the year :

' The X-Files : I Want to Believe ' This pretentious spiritual non-thriller signaled a sorry end for Scully and Mulder .
Still , at least no expense was lavished on what looked like an extended TV special .

' What Happens in Vegas ' Ashton Kutcher steals the washroom door .
That 's how desperate things get in this total bust , probably the least romantic romantic comedy of the year .

' 88 Minutes ' Al Pacino has 88 minutes to live ... yet this mind-bogglingly dumb movie dies agonizingly slowly .

' Seven Pounds ' You have to sit through the entirety of Will Smith 's soggy new movie to find out just how shameless it is .
I 'd rather take a bath with a jellyfish .

' Fool 's Gold ' Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey 's vacation snapshots would have been more amusing than this torpid exotic adventure .
Oh , wait , these WERE the vacation snapshots .. .

' Australia ' Just because Baz Luhrmann loves old Hollywood movies does n't mean he can make one .
Where 's Crocodile Dundee when you need him ?

' Eagle Eye ' A big-budget tech thriller -- apparently suggested by Steven Spielberg himself -- that borrowed from all over but made absolutely no sense .

' The Mummy : Tomb of the Dragon Emperor ' It does n't get much sloppier than this mummy movie without a mummy .
Rachel Weisz made a shrewd choice not to return .

' The Spirit ' Granted , I hated '300, ' and 'Sin City ' left me cold , but at least they had a degree of technical accomplishment to wrap around Frank Miller 's puerile pulp fascism .
His own movie is just an inept embarrassment .

' Funny Games ' Michael Haneke is a prodigiously talented filmmaker , but this shot-for-shot American remake of his Austrian thriller was an arrogant , redundant scold and the very worst reason to see a movie all year .
