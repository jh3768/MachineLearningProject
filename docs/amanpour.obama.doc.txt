Amanpour: World has questions for Obama - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- Will President Obama talk just about the state of this troubled Union whose economic crisis he has inherited , or will he cast his net of ideas far and wide to address a new American relationship with the world ?

Aides say the president is expected to focus on the economy when he addresses a joint session of Congress Tuesday evening , but will also touch lightly on foreign policy issues .

After much talk of engaging America 's adversaries , chief among them Iran , the Obama administration has made no move so far , pending a policy review .

But Iranian leaders from President Ahmadinejad on down have sent letters and delivered speeches welcoming a change of U.S. policy and declaring themselves to be ready for talks , 30 years after relations were ruptured by the Islamic revolution .

Iran 's help in Iraq and Afghanistan could be useful , though its uranium enrichment program proceeds apace .

But the International Atomic Energy Agency , the United Nations ' nuclear watchdog , says Iran seems to be slowing down its centrifuge operations , perhaps as a political gesture of good will .

If Iran is slowly unclenching its fist , will Obama offer an outstretched hand Tuesday night ?

Facing a two-front war that the Obama administration now calls AFPAK -- for Afghanistan and Pakistan -- will the president define a strategy for winning ?

He has already announced 17,000 more U.S. troops for Afghanistan but seems to be pulling back from a promise to help rebuild Afghanistan and promote democracy there .

Meantime , as the United States steadily loses hearts and minds in airstrikes that kill too many civilians , the Taliban is steadily growing stronger in Afghanistan .
Across the border in Pakistan too the Taliban is gathering strength , threatening stability there as well as the U.S. ability to resupply its troops in Afghanistan .

Will Obama lay out how he will help Pakistan 's new civilian government properly take on the Taliban and al Qaeda militants ?

While promising to make Middle East peace a top priority , the president now faces a new dilemma , as Israel 's recent elections look set to return Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu to power if he can put together a coalition .

Netanyahu and his right-wing allies could be on a collision course with the Obama administration , as they reject the idea of negotiations to create a Palestinian state and threaten to build more Israeli settlements on occupied Palestinian land , which violates U.S. policy .

Will Obama lay down the administration 's red lines for his road map for peace ?

And then there is Russia .
Vice President Joe Biden has already called for 'resetting the button ' on U.S.-Russia relations , which were badly strained between Presidents Bush and Putin .
iReport.com : What do you want to hear from Obama ?

The new president , Dmitry Medvedev , seems to be pushing back against some of Putin 's policies , and there are reports of a possible U.S.-Russia minisummit in April .

Still , issues such as U.S. plans for a missile defense shield in Eastern Europe continue to strain relations with Russia .

Obama 's secretary of state has already taken his message on the road to China and elsewhere in Asia , and special envoys have also been deployed .
But on April Fool 's Day , President Obama himself sets off on his maiden voyage to the world stage .

It will be to London for the G-20 summit , where he 'll meet leaders from Europe to Russia to Saudi Arabia .

With Tuesday 's speech coming about a month ahead of that trip , allies around the world will hope to hear Obama outline a return to the relationship of consultation , cooperation and compromise .
