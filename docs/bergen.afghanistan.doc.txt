Commentary: Letter to Obama -- How to rescue war in Afghanistan - CNN.com
Editor 's note : Peter Bergen is CNN 's national security analyst .
His most recent book is 'The Osama bin Laden I Know : An Oral History of al Qaeda 's Leader .
' This is one in a series of 'letters to the new president ' that will appear as commentaries on CNN.com in coming weeks .
This commentary is based , in part , on an paper Bergen wrote for the New America Foundation , where he is a senior fellow , and an article he wrote for The New Republic in September , 'A Man , A Plan , Afghanistan. '

( CNN ) -- Sir , during the election campaign , you often said that getting Afghanistan and Pakistan right and ending the threat from al Qaeda were vital for American national interests .

In an effort to have an effective policy to do that , it is important to define the greatest challenges facing the United States in Afghanistan and Pakistan , in order of importance .
They are :

& # 8226 ; Eliminating the safe haven al Qaeda enjoys on the Afghan-Pakistan border .

& # 8226 ; Providing security to the Afghan population .

& # 8226 ; Eliminating the growing tactical threat posed by the Taliban on both sides of the border .

& # 8226 ; Providing tangible reconstruction and development efforts in Afghanistan and in the tribal border regions of Pakistan .

& # 8226 ; Ending , or at least curtailing , the opium/heroin trade in Afghanistan .

& # 8226 ; Expanding the legitimate , largely agricultural economy in Afghanistan .

& # 8226 ; Holding fair and secure presidential elections in 2009 in Afghanistan .

To achieve these goals , the following eight steps must be taken within Afghanistan :

Build the size of the Afghan army and police .

Classic counterinsurgency doctrine suggests that Afghanistan needs something like half a million additional soldiers and police officers to secure its population .
There are only 70,000 police officers ( and an equal number in the military ) in the entire country , which is wracked by a violent insurgency in its eastern and southern provinces and increasingly in its central provinces .
It is also the center of the world 's heroin trade .
Compare this to New York City , which alone has about 36,000 police officers .

And Afghanistan , with its high mountain ranges and a land mass a third larger than Iraq 's , is a country ideally suited to guerrilla warfare .
Moreover , its population is 4 million or so greater than Iraq 's , yet there are three times more soldiers and police in Iraq than in Afghanistan .

Because the U.S. military and NATO are now stretched to the breaking point , the vast majority of additional soldiers and police officers must be supplied by the Afghans .
What the U.S. and NATO need to do is to send in more Special Forces and civilian advisers who specialize in the training of indigenous forces .

Solve the security shortfall in the short term .

Establish tribal militias of 50 to 300 men to establish security at the district level and provide a counterweight to local militants .
Ordinary Afghans tend to trust their tribal shuras ( councils ) to solve their problems , and these 'Sons of Afghanistan ' could fill the security void until the Afghan army and police grew in size and ability so as to be able to secure the country -- a process likely to take many years .
Such tribal militias could be paid with U.S. funds , just as the Sons of Iraq have been .

Reduce the size of the insurgency .

Just as important as building up the Afghan army and police force is combating the insurgency by reducing its size .
At the 2001 Bonn Conference that set the stage for the present Afghan government , there were no mechanisms to include the Taliban .
This is no longer a viable position .
An effective amnesty program has disarmed hundreds of Taliban soldiers ; the time has now come to reach out quietly to more senior members of the Taliban who are open to negotiating a lasting peace

Embark on effective reconstruction .

The United States should focus on completing three high-profile projects that will have real benefits for the Afghan people .
The first is to turn on the lights in Kabul , which receives on average only a few hours of electricity a day .

The second is to secure the important Kandahar-to-Kabul road , which was opened as a blacktop freeway with much hoopla in 2003 but is now a suicidal route for anyone driving it without a security detail .

The third is to finish building the Kajaki Dam in southern Afghanistan , which will provide electricity to 2 million Afghans , most of whom live deep in Taliban country .

Additional American aid should be tied in part to an Afghan public employment program similar to the Works Progress Administration program that President Franklin Roosevelt instituted during the Great Depression .

Afghanistan has a chronic 40 percent official unemployment rate .
It also has a desperate need for new roads and dams , and must repair the agricultural aqueducts destroyed by years of war .
Meanwhile , Kabul and other major Afghan cities are awash in debris and trash .
Cleaning up that rubbish would have a salutary effect on the residents of those cities .

Hold a free , fair and secure election in 2009 .

Looking ahead , it is vitally important that the presidential election scheduled for August , when Hamid Karzai 's five-year term as president is up , be seen as fair and inclusive as possible .
NATO and the United States will have to pay the costs of the election -- hundreds of millions of dollars the Afghan government simply does n't have -- and focus on providing security , particularly in the south , so the election can go forward without significant interference from the Taliban .

Decouple the Taliban from the drug trade .

Feeding the Taliban 's comeback is the boneheaded U.S. counter-narcotics strategy of poppy field eradication .
Two million Afghan farmers and their families survive on poppy production , and those whose crops are destroyed are generally the poorer ones who ca n't pay the bribes to have their fields left alone .
It 's no surprise that those farmers are easy recruits to the Taliban cause .

Instead of penalizing farmers who cultivate poppies because they have few other options , the United States needs to invest in the legitimate Afghan agricultural economy by providing subsidies , price supports and seeds for alternative crops , and by building the road system that will get those crops to market .
As Lt. Gen. David Barno , the U.S. military commander in Afghanistan from 2003 to 2005 , has said , the measure of success of a successful counter-narcotics policy should not be hectares of poppy destroyed every year but hectares of other crops that are planted .

To end the culture of impunity that Afghan drug kingpins enjoy , the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration should make public the list of the country 's top drug suspects , including government officials , a practice that would probably see results in Afghanistan 's shame-based culture .

It appears that the list has not been published because it would embarrass certain officials in the Karzai government .
Publication is long overdue .

Because Afghanistan 's judicial system is still too weak to handle major drug cases , Washington and Kabul should sign an extradition treaty allowing Afghan drug kingpins to be tried in the United States , as has happened with Colombian drug lords .

And now that the United States is finally talking to Iran , which has perhaps the highest percentage of heroin users in the world , one area of strong common interest should be closing the trafficking routes on Afghanistan 's western border .

Fix the problems in the NATO mission .

In all of this , the United States must take the lead .
Over the past three years , since NATO took over responsibility for military operations in the north , west and south of the country , violence has grown exponentially .
Although the Taliban 's resurgence is not NATO 's fault , it 's time to recognize that NATO 's involvement in Afghanistan has been a strategic failure .

Although it is still politically and financially useful for the overall operation to be a genuine multicountry coalition , the time has come for the United States to admit that military operations , particularly in the unsettled south , must be taken over by American forces , with help from those allied Special Forces that are up to the job .

Even the most able NATO allies do n't have the capability of American forces , and other NATO allies come to the table so freighted with 'national caveats ' about what they can and can not do that they are largely useless in battle .

End coalition air strikes that have a high probability of killing civilians .

If the United States wants to stop adding fuel to the Taliban fire , it must stop killing civilians .
Because Afghanistan is an operation that attempts to act with a minimum of troops on the ground , U.S. military operations rely on airstrikes far more often than is the case in Iraq , with predictable consequences .

In a 2007 ABC News/BBC survey , 34 percent of Afghans said civilians had been killed or seriously injured by coalition forces in the area where they lived .

Of the 700 civilians killed in the first six months of 2008 , about a third were killed by Afghan , American or NATO soldiers , according to U.N. figures. That is an improvement over the same time period in 2007 , when , the U.N. found , coalition forces killed more civilians than the Taliban .
But the numbers must continue to come down .

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Peter Bergen .
His letter to the president on steps to take in Pakistan will appear next week on CNN.com .
