NEW YORK ( AP ) -- Rescuers suspended their search Sunday for a 10-year-old girl in the water off Coney Island , one of three swimmers still missing from powerful ocean currents at New York City and Long Island beaches over the weekend .

Four other victims drowned at local beaches Friday and Saturday , authorities said .

The search for the girl was suspended Sunday afternoon pending further developments , Coast Guard Cmdr .
Gregory Hitchen said .

Akira Johnson was pulled under by currents while swimming with her cousin Saturday afternoon .
Her cousin , Tyriek Currie , also 10 , was rescued .

The children 's grandfather , Charles German , went to the beach Sunday to watch the search effort .
He said the family was doing as well as could be expected .

With a steady punch of stronger rip currents possible over the weekend , 'only experienced surf swimmers should enter the waters, ' said National Weather Service meteorologist Jim Connolly .

A strong storm system spawned rough seas and 8-foot waves to the area earlier this week , Connolly said .
