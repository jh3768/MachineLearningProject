How to save money in the next three weeks - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- Jo-Lynne Shane is furiously looking for ways to spend $ 500 in the next three weeks .
If she does n't , that money will disappear at the stroke of midnight December 31 .

Shane , a mother of three who lives in a suburb of Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , has that much money left in her family 's healthcare Flexible Spending Account .
By the rules of the IRS , any money she does n't spend by the end of this year vanishes .

' If you do n't use it , you lose it, ' said Shane , who gives cost-cutting tips to other mothers on her blog , Musings of a Housewife .

She admits that it can hard to focus on finances during the holiday season .
But if you do n't want to lose money in the next three weeks , follow these five tips from health insurance experts .

Flexible Spending Accounts ( FSA )

These are accounts where your employer takes pre-tax dollars out of your paycheck to be spent on health-care expenses .
You decide how much to take out each year .

Sometimes people think they can use FSA money only to pay for doctor 's bills and prescription drugs , but many over-the-counter items -- from acne drugs to wart removers -- are legitimate FSA expenses .

Here 's an A to Z list of eligible FSA expenses , and here 's a guide to reimbursement for over-the-counter products .

Some people actually have until March 15 to spend their 2008 FSA money .
Check with your employer to find out your situation .

Vision benefits

If your plan gives you money toward a new pair of eyeglasses every year , or contact lenses , make sure to use these benefits before they expire at the end of the year .

Elective surgeries

' Let 's say you need knee surgery and you 've been putting it off for a while .
If you 've already met your deductible for 2008 , have the surgery before the end of the year , or you 'll have to start your deductible all over again, ' said Amy O'Meara Chambers , an employee benefits lawyer and associate vice president for market development at Priority Health , a health insurance company based in Michigan .

For example , let 's say your insurance has a $ 1,000 annual deductible .
This means you have to spend $ 1,000 of your own money before insurance kicks in .

If you 've met your deductible for 2008 , have the surgery now , or else you 'll have to pay that $ 1,000 deductible when you have the surgery next year .

The same goes for doctor 's appointments if you 've met your deductible .

' Go to the dermatologist , dentist , optometrist and other appointments you might have put off, ' advised Tobie Stanger , a senior editor at Consumer Reports .

Prescription drugs

It 's the same principle as the elective surgeries .
If you can , fill prescriptions now so you wo n't have to shell out whatever your deductible is next year .
Stanger advises purchasing a three-month supply before the end of the year if possible .

Wellness requirements

A new trend among employers is to offer rewards -- gift cards , cash or lower premiums -- to employees who take certain wellness initiatives , such as joining a health club or getting an annual physical .

' A lot of these offers are very time-sensitive ; you have to do them by the end of the year to get the rewards, ' O'Meara Chambers said .
' So make sure you do n't miss out. '

As for Shane , she 's working on a plan with her orthodontist to pay now for $ 300 worth of work she knows she 'll need in 2009 .
As for the other $ 200 that will be left in her FSA , she 's thinking about buying contact lenses she knows she 'll need in the future .

If that does n't do it , her husband , Paul , has an idea .
' He says we can always go to CVS and stock up on Tylenol and Band-Aids, ' she said .
