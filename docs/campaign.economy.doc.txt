Presidential hopefuls eye the economy - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- The economy is the No .
1 issue on the minds of American voters , and Sens .
John McCain and Barack Obama offer vastly different plans to improve it .

McCain told a group of small-business owners Tuesday that his goal as president will be 'to get our economy running at full strength again. '

The senator from Arizona is attempting to paint Obama as a typical Democrat who wants to raise taxes and regulate government , charging that Obama would institute the largest tax increase in more than 60 years .

Obama is telling voters that McCain 's economic plan 'amounts to a full-throated endorsement of George Bush 's policies. '

Speaking at the National Small Business Summit in Washington , McCain laid out the differences between his economic proposals and Obama 's plan .

' On tax policy , health-care reform , trade , government spending and a long list of other issues , we offer very different choices to the American people, ' he said .

' No matter which of us wins in November , there will be change in Washington .
The question is , what kind of change ?
... Will we enact the largest single tax increase since the Second World War , as my opponent proposes , or will we keep taxes low for families and employers ?
... This election offers Americans a very distinct choice about what kind of change we will have. '

Obama kicked off his two-week campaign swing Monday focusing on the economy .
His tour takes him through battleground states that will be up for grabs in November .

Obama blasted McCain 's economic plan as a 'continuation of Bush economic policies : more tax cuts to the wealthy , more corporate tax breaks , more mountains of debt and little to no relief for families struggling with the rising costs of everything from health care to gas prices to a college education. '

McCain said Tuesday that 'under Sen. Obama 's tax plan , Americans of every background would see their taxes rise : seniors , parents , small-business owners .

In response to McCain 's speech , Obama said McCain 's prescription for the economy is 'wrong for the country ' and McCain 's characterization of his plan is 'just wrong. '

' Let me be clear .
My tax reform plan would cut taxes for 95 percent of workers .
... I 've said that John McCain is running to serve out a third Bush term .
But the truth is , when it comes to taxes , that 's not being fair to George Bush, ' Obama said .

Obama said Monday that lawmakers should inject an additional $ 50 billion into the economy .

' Such relief ca n't wait until the next president takes office .
... That 's why I 've called for another round of fiscal stimulus , an immediate $ 50 billion to help those who 've been hit hardest by this economic downturn, ' Obama told a crowd in Raleigh , North Carolina .
He said he supports the expansion and extension of unemployment benefits , as well as a second round of tax rebate checks .

The economy is likely to be at the center of the race for the White House .
According to a CNN poll released last week , it 's the most important issue for voters in deciding whom to vote for , topping Iraq , health care , terrorism and immigration .

And the issue could n't be more polarizing .
McCain and Obama represent opposite ends of the economic spectrum .

McCain is a classic fiscal conservative who believes in a smaller government that should lower taxes .
Obama thinks the government should play a more active role in leveling the field for lower income workers .

McCain thinks the government should boost the economy by having lower tax rates , which would in turn increase savings .
He supports making permanent the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 , and he wants to repeal the Alternative Minimum Tax .

That tax was put in place to make sure the wealthy paid personal income tax , but it now causes many middle-class Americans to pay higher federal taxes than they used to .

Obama puts more of a focus on the budget deficit .
He would keep the Bush tax cuts in place for most Americans , but not for those who make roughly $ 250,000 a year or more .
He would also get rid of income taxes for seniors making less than $ 50,000 annually .

McCain thinks the best way to deal with the deficit is by scaling back government spending .
He proposes a one-year freeze on discretionary spending to assess which programs should stay and which should go .
He has also said he would demand that Congress eliminate earmarks .

Obama has said he wants to cut earmarks to levels no greater than they were in 2001 and reinstate so-called pay-as-you-go rules , under which lawmakers can not pass spending measures or tax cuts without paying for them by making cuts to other programs or raising an equal amount of money .

The two presidential candidates also offer different solutions for dealing with unemployment .
Obama thinks the government should help create jobs .

McCain thinks corporate taxes should be cut so businesses have more money to hire new workers .

On the housing and mortgage crisis , McCain would consider greater intervention by the federal government to limit effects of mortgage crisis if current measures fail .
He believes a government bailout should be a last resort .

Obama proposes creating a $ 10 billion fund to help prevent foreclosures and eliminating some taxes and fees for families who must sell their homes .
He would also provide tax credits to 10 million middle class homeowners who struggle with mortgage costs .

McCain also pushes the idea of suspending the federal gas tax for the summer , but Obama has called that plan a gimmick .
