Flying the friendlier skies? Delta gives air etiquette tips - CNN.com
ATLANTA , Georgia ( AP ) -- Volumes have been written about how to properly behave at weddings or which fork to use at fancy dinners .

But when it comes to dealing with the neighboring passenger who hogs precious airline arm space or the unruly kid who wo n't pipe down on crowded flights , there 's precious little out there .

Until now .
Delta Air Lines Inc. is trying to raise awareness of behavior in the air by creating an animated series of videos showing passengers confronted with delicate social situations .

The Atlanta-based company is rolling out 'Planeguage : The language of traveling by plane, ' a series of 25 humorous videos the airline has posted online and introduced on flights this month .

' We understand what you go through as a traveler, ' said Tim Mapes , Delta 's vice president of marketing .
' These videos can reinforce , 'Hey , you do n't want to be that guy .

The snippets include 'Middleman, ' about the middle-seat bully ; 'Kidtastrophe, ' depicting unruly tots on planes ; 'Lav Dance, ' about the person who bumps into everyone in the airplane aisle while returning from the lavatory ; and 'Shady Lady, ' about the passenger who raises or closes the window shade without considering other passengers .

The videos , which were created after Delta officials heard customers talk about experiences aboard planes , are meant to 'help raise travelers ' consciousness about what it means to be good travel companions, ' said spokeswoman Betsy Talton .

Airlines and customers have differed on what it means to be a good traveler .
Southwest Airlines Co. was criticized for telling a young woman in July that her outfit was too revealing to fly .
Chief Executive Gary Kelly issued an apology to the young woman , Kyla Ebbert , that was read on 'The Dr. Phil Show. '

' We expect our employees to use good judgment , common sense and good taste and we feel if our customers do the same we wo n't have issues on board a flight, ' said Southwest spokesman Chris Mainz , who said his airline may consider following Delta 's lead .
' Good judgment serves everyone well ... usually you can find common ground. '

Part of the problem is that airlines have n't properly educated the public on what to expect aboard a plane , said Andrew R. Thomas , an assistant professor of international business at the University of Akron and an author of books on air travel and security .
And growth in air travel has meant thousands of new passengers who have never been in the air , he said .

' The airlines have finally caught on to the fact that the amount of people traveling , especially the amount of people who have n't traveled before is exponentially rising, ' Thomas said .
' There has to be some kind of ( process ) where people can become familiar with the travel experience and hopefully not while in flight. '

The move has been applauded by some Delta passengers , including Larry Pellegrini , a 52-year-old sales executive who said his biggest pet peeve on his weekly flights are passengers who do not cover their mouths when they cough .

' There should be an education process ... when it comes to proper etiquette ' in the air , he said .

It has also won praise from Anna Post -- the great-great-granddaughter of etiquette icon Emily Post -- who said the videos could be an effective way to teach passengers how to better fly the friendly skies .

' The more aware people are about how their actions affect others , the better the chances are that they 'll make more of an effort to be considerate, ' said Post , who leads business etiquette seminars at The Emily Post Institute in Burlington , Vermont .

' The times when I see rudeness happening is when I do n't see people being self-aware .
It 's great to see an airline acknowledge they understand the crazy situations passengers go through. '
