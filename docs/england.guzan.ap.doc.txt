Guzan close to signing for Villa - CNN.com
BIRMINGHAM , England ( AP ) -- United States goalkeeper Brad Guzan is on the verge of moving to the Premier League after Chivas USA agreed a transfer fee with Aston Villa on Saturday .

The switch from Major League Soccer is reliant on Guzan obtaining British work permit , which thwarted a deal in January .

The Birmingham club are more confident that that barrier can be overcome now that Guzan has made some more international appearances , including playing against England at Wembley in May .

' Aston Villa can confirm that a fee has been agreed this morning for Brad Guzan and he will become a Villa player subject to gaining a work permit, ' the club said Saturday .

Villa have just one senior goalkeeper , Stuart Taylor , after Thomas Sorensen was released and Scott Carson returned to Liverpool following a loan spell .

The 24-year-old Guzan would be the fourth American goalkeeper currently in the Premier League , after Blackburn 's Brad Friedel , Everton 's Tim Howard and Fulham 's Kasey Keller .

' Hopefully it will all go and I will be able to sign, ' said Guzan .

Guzan played in the 1-1 draw with the LA Galaxy on Friday in what was likely to have been his last game for Chivas .

' I would love to sign for Villa, ' Guzan said .
' When I was there in January for a few days , it was an absolutely brilliant time .
Great people , great facilities and I could n't say one bad thing about it .. .

' Being amongst good people who understand the game of football and are able to put players out on the pitch to compete week in , week out , that is important to me and that is what I want to be involved in .

' It looks like exciting times at Villa and I would love to play for Martin O'Neill, ' Guzan said .
' When I met Martin at the end of January , he was a fabulous guy , a great person .
The entire staff were outstanding .

Guzan was named MLS goalkeeper of the year in October after his third year as a professional .
He led Chivas to the best record in the Western Conference and ranked first among goalkeepers , with 13 clean sheets .
