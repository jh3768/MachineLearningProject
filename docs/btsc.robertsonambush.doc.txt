Here , Nic Robertson writes about an ambush that still haunts the soldiers fighting along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border .

KABUL , Afghanistan ( CNN ) -- I 've been on many military embeds .
But when I stepped off the Black Hawk Helicopter at Forward Operating Base Keating , I knew it was like no other I 'd been to .

We 'd landed on boulders in the middle of two fast-flowing rivers , in the remote mountains of Afghanistan , just 15 miles from the Pakistan border on September 12 .
Mountains towered over us , incredibly steep and imposing , on all sides .
The sun sets early here .

As the bird lifted off , leaving us behind on the razor-wired base , I felt exposed and not very safe .
I instantly realized how strange it was -- this combination of utter remoteness , along with the penetrating gaze of an unseen enemy on these dark mountain slopes .

Keating is a small base , with rough-hewn rock huts thrown together in a tight gaggle on the only flat ground between the foot of the mountain and the river .

I 'd been told by Battalion Commander Lt. Col. Chris Kolenda what a tough posting this was .
Most days it gets attacked .
Kolenda told me about an ambush that wounded two dozen American and Afghan troops and claimed the lives of two men , Capt .
Tom Bostick and Sgt .
William Fritsche .

As it turned out I must have brought some strange mountain luck with me .
During my five days , I did n't hear a single bullet , rocket or mortar fired in anger .

But that gave me a chance to get to know the soldiers at Keating .
And when I saw the tags on their battle fatigues , I saw the names of the men in Kolenda 's ambush story : Newsom , Meyer , Wilson .
Capt. Joey Hutto , too .
He 'd been a very close friend of Bostick .
I could tell he was still cut up by the loss .

Some men had been given medication to get over the trauma of the ambush .
A few had even been reassigned to help them cope .
But what came across to me time and time again was how much these men did n't want their friends forgotten .

The more I heard them tell what happened during that day , July 27 , I knew I had to tell their story : Put it on the record , so it could never be lost .

I left Keating humbled by those men .
