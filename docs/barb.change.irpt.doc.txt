Rademacher , 57 , used to be a jogger , but about 20 years ago , while running , she fell and cracked both of her knees .
Her knees still hurt when she tries to run , or on cold days , and arthritis adds to the burden , she said .

Today , she 'll run sometimes when her dogs insist , and she uses knee braces to help with the pain .
But generally she 's exercised less and less in the past two years .

' I just felt better when I was working out regularly, ' she said .

She considers herself just slightly overweight , and might want to lose about 10 pounds , she said .
But she wants to exercise more to feel better physically , she said .

She 's also thinking about getting an advanced degree in education this year .

Rademacher teaches algebra at Northwest Arkansas Community College .
She said she likes helping people see the connection between different facts and discover patterns .

' I teach a lot of people who say , 'Oh , I was never good at math, ' and to see them change their definition of themselves , that 's worth it, ' she said .
' That 's worth the whole thing , when somebody changes their attitude towards math. '

Rademacher , who lives with her four dogs and three cats , was already making small changes to start her goals as soon as the new year began .
She created a calendar to keep track of positive change activities , such as drinking more water daily .

Her favorite hobby is contributing videos to iReport.com .
Before discovering citizen journalism , she was a less active person , simply going to school to teach and then coming home , she said .

Hooked on the iReport concept , she bought a $ 500 camcorder and lots of accessories , including a lapel microphone .

She recently filmed an Inauguration Day party at a local pizza bar and volunteer events for Martin Luther King Day .
She also interviewed a couple who built a home from old vehicle tires and hay .
