Review: Sex, drugs and Mom and Dad - CNN.com
NEW YORK ( AP ) -- Relax , everybody .
Despite its racy come-on , the new CBS drama 'Swingtown ' is n't pushing recreational drugs and mate swapping , any more than it endorses smoking on airplanes or drinking Harvey Wallbangers , which are also part of the 1970s world it inhabits .

Granted , one of the show 's three married couples are swingers , a sexy husband and wife always looking for attractive new playmates .

' Opening up our relationship was the best thing that ever happened to me and Tom, ' Trina tells Susan , who , with husband Bruce and their two kids , has just moved across the street in this upscale Chicago suburb .

It 's July 1976 -- the nation 's much-awaited bicentennial -- and the party Tom and Trina are throwing is heating up .

In their open marriage they have reached 'this whole other level of intimacy, ' Trina explains , washing down a pill with a sip of champagne , then offering one to Susan .
' Quaalude ? It will take the edge off. '

You can probably guess where this is headed , even as you wonder how the heck 'Swingtown ' landed on CBS and not , say , HBO .

Simple .
' Swingtown ' ( which premieres Thursday at 10 p.m. EDT ) turns out not to be 'That '70s Partner-Swapping Show .
' Instead , it 's much more like 'thirtysomething ' in an earlier era .
Call it 'nineteen-seventies-something .
' It 's an entertaining drama populated by likable , relatable people sharing modern life experiences , few of which require taking off their clothes .

Tom ( played by Grant Show , one-time hunk on 'Melrose Place ' ) is a dashing airline pilot whose wife ( Lana Parrilla ) , a former stewardess , is among the many stewardesses he 's been with .
But she 's the only one he loves -- and the only one to whom he brings other stewardesses for the occasional menage a trois .

Susan ( played by Molly Parker , who on HBO 's 'Deadwood ' was the upright young widow Alma Garret ) is married to Bruce ( Jack Davenport ) , a commodities trader on the rise .
With his latest promotion , he has moved the family to a bigger house in a fancier area .

Susan is a full-time mom to two teenagers , one of whom , overbright daughter Laurie , often says more than she should -- as when Susan gently asks if she is sleeping with her boyfriend .

' I get that I 'm the same age that you were , when Dad knocked you up, ' Laurie answers .
' But you do n't need to worry , cause I 'm smarter than that. '

' I know, ' smiles Susan , no more wounded than pleased by her daughter 's reply .

As with a lot of what she deals with , Susan has mixed feelings about her family 's upgraded status .
She feels like she 's betraying her best friend , Janet , whom she left behind in her old , squarely middle-class neighborhood .

' To be honest , change is good, ' Susan rationalizes .
' I feel like I 'm ready for the next thing. '

But all Janet can see is more of the same thing as wife of milquetoast Roger ( Josh Hopkins ) and mother of a teenage son who wants his own distance .

' Why is it , no matter how hard I try, ' says Janet bitterly , 'everything seems to be falling apart around me ? '

Played with tragicomic flair by Miriam Shor , she 's a desperate housewife with a martyr complex .

What will be the impact of the '70s on Janet and the other characters ?

' Swingtown ' joins them there in the so-called Me Decade .
It 's the gap between the Vietnam War 's end and President Nixon 's resignation , and , at the other side , revolutions sparked by Reaganism and the personal computer .
It 's a time for saying goodbye to the '60s with relief , while trying to keep the experiment going .
When people still believe they can have it both ways .

Open marriage ?

' It 's not cheating, ' Trina maintains .
' It 's the opposite , actually. '

Of course , other ideas that seemed right at the time include soda cans with pull-off tabs that littered the landscape .
A beyond-tacky style sense that makes us cringe today .
Scratchy-sounding eight-track tapes of terrible music .

' Swingtown ' makes use of all these cultural cues , not for derision , but with pleasure and affection .

Period music , by the way , is heard almost nonstop , telegraphing each twist in the narrative : 'Spirit in the Sky ' from one-hit wonder Norman Greenbaum introduces Tom , the pilot ; David Bowie 's 'Golden Years ' accompanies the kids in high school .

And in the party scene where Trina and Tom begin to get cozy with Susan and Bruce -- all still fully clothed , just touching hands -- the tune is a cheesy yet ear-caressing classic : Gary Wright 's 'Dream Weaver. '

It sets the mood for this foursome to go further .
Then the scene fades out .

What you see on 'Swingtown ' is n't risque behavior but the issues underlying the choices made , along with their consequences .
Assuming you were n't there for real , 'Swingtown ' opens you up so you might ask yourself : What would I have done ?

That 's always a good question for drama to inspire .
