Flyers beware: Altitude sickness isn't just for climbers - CNN.com
Every year millions of people go to the mountains for backpacking , skiing , mountain climbing and other activities and are surprised to find that they do n't feel well .
It 's because the higher you climb above sea level , the less oxygen there is in the air .
This causes problems for people who normally live at lower altitudes because their bodies are n't used to working on so little oxygen .
A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in July 2007 found that even some airline passengers can fall victim to altitude sickness .
