Legend Costa-Gavras shoots new film on home turf  - CNN.com
LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- You could say controversy is Constantin Costa-Gavras ' middle name .

In a career that has spanned more than 40 years , the Greek award-winning director 's highly political movies have earned him a reputation as one of the world 's greatest thriller directors .

Telling stories with emotional bite is Costa-Gavras ' passion .
His films are often based on real events ( the following counter-disclaimer runs in the opening credits of thriller 'Z ' : 'Any resemblance to real events , to persons living or dead , is not accidental .
It is DELIBERATE .
' ) and told with an authenticity and sense of outrage that has politicized generations , and wowed cineastes and critics alike .

After so long making films , it 's hard to imagine there are many things the Greek director has n't seen or done ( he was a ballet dancer for a time ) but he is shooting his latest film 'Eden is West ' in Greece -- for the first time in his 21 film career .

' It was amazing to find this place in Greece , it was always a problem for me to make a movie in Greece of course, ' the 74 year-old film veteran told CNN on set in Crete .

' Eden is West ' tells the story of illegal immigrants living in the EU , going right to the heart of one of contemporary Europe 's most sensitive issues .

' It 's an Odyssey with Ulysses, ' explains Costa-Gavras .
' A modern , young Ulysses .
He does n't want to go back to his house it 's the story of millions of people .
They emigrate , they are looking for a place to have a house and a job , a wife , to live like normal human beings .

' That 's [ Elias ' ] story , his dream is to go to Paris , because it is magical , the city of light .
So , he has to cross part of Europe , Italy , Germany and France and then he gets to Paris .
And the whole kind of adventures , the immigrant and his adventures , to show our people how we are , Westerners in front of these people. '

Such material could be turgid in the wrong hands .
' Are we superior ?
' asks Costa-Gavras .
' We make war because we feel superior ... and bad actions are part of our psychology. '

But he says he wants to deal with the issues 'in a light way ' and handling the tough stuff entertainingly is a Costa-Gavras hallmark .

His big break on the international scene came in 1968 when he directed French-language thriller 'Z .
' It charts the real events surrounding the assassination of Greek reformist politician Grigoris Lambrakis .

' Z ' holds a mirror up to 1960s Greek society and the military junta in power at the time did n't like what it saw .
The closing credits list some of the things banned by the junta including labor unions , long hair on men , The Beatles , sociology and Mark Twain .

Unsurprisingly , 'Z ' was also banned , but in other countries like France it was a huge success .
Costa-Gavras was awarded the Jury Prize at Cannes and the Best Foreign Language film Oscar in 1969 .
The film remains a landmark of political cinema .

Age has not mellowed Costa-Gavras ' terrier-like curiosity and in 'Amen ' ( 2002 ) he asks why the Vatican remained silent during the Nazi Holocaust .

The film 's poster -- an image of a swastika that morphs into a crucifix -- was created by the notorious Italian designer Toscani who is best known for a highly-controversial Benetton ad campaign showing a man dying of AIDS .

Costa-Gavras ' formative experiences were pivotal to the path he would choose as a director .

As a young man his opportunities for study and work were stifled by the junta which had blacklisted his father for his activities in the Greek resistance during WWII .

When he failed to get a visa to study in the U.S. -- the country whose films had so mesmerised him as a boy -- he went to Paris and studied at the Sorbonne before completing his training at the French national film school .

Costa-Gavras made his first film , 'The Sleeping Car Murder, ' a detective thriller starring Yves Montand ( the French actor and crooner who had a highly-publicised affair with Marilyn Monroe ) in 1965 and has been based in France ever since , saying 'the only place to make [ these ] movies is France. '

Nevertheless , after the extraordinary success of 'Z ' in 1969 he was overwhelmed by offers from Hollywood .
It is said that Costa-Gavras turned down 'The Godfather ' before it was offered to Francis Ford Coppola .
He made four U.S. movies including 'Missing ' ( 1982 ) .

The story of the kidnapping and death-squad murder of Charles Horman , a liberal American journalist in Chile finally allowed Costa-Gavras to weave his fascination with U.S. political culture into a film .

U.S. audiences responded enthusiastically to the story , aided by inspired performances from Sissy Spacek and comic actor Jack Lemmon who won the Best Actor award at Cannes .
Costa-Gavras picked up the Palme D'Or and an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay that year .

It was also the year the director took over directorship of the Cin&eacute ; math&egrave ; que Fran&ccedil ; aise in Paris , which holds the largest collection of films and related documents in the world .

During his five years in charge he proved a dogged champion of film preservation and artistic freedom and helped rescue the institution from decay and disarray .

Now he 's back on hometurf in Crete and fighting a different battle -- this time financial .

He needs a cargo ship for 'Eden is West 's ' crucial opening scene in the Cretian port of Heraklion .
Time is running out and even if he does find one , hiring a boat will eat up a substantial part of the film 's budget .

' We went on a boat that transports illegals , it happens all the time , so we tried to find a broken down one , an old boat and the ship owners , sell them or abandon them , when they are full of people, ' he sighs .

Despite the stresses of filmmaking at an age when most people would be slowing down , the man , who was once a ballet dancer , still has movies he wants to make : 'It 's an old dream .
I would like to make a musical. '

Knowing Costa-Gavras , it 's unlikely to be a rom-com .
