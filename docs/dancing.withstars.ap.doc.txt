Yamaguchi bests the boys in 'Dancing' finale - CNN.com
LOS ANGELES ( AP ) -- Kristi Yamaguchi could n't have done any better at the 'Dancing With the Stars ' finals Monday .
The figure-skating champ earned a perfect score of 60 for her two dances Monday , putting her far ahead of fellow finalists Cristian de la Fuente , who scored 52 , and Jason Taylor , who finished with 51 .

Each performed a freestyle routine , and the three finalists shared the floor for a group dance dubbed 'the cha-cha face-off .
' Yamaguchi came out on top both times .

' It 's ladies ' night .
You won that hands down, ' judge Carrie Ann Inaba told the Olympian after the group dance .
Her perfect score easily bested de la Fuente 's 26 points and Taylor 's 24 .

All three freestyle dances featured funky moves and lifts aplenty , but Yamaguchi tossed in some hip-hop grooves , a little Latin flair and even helped flip her professional partner , Mark Ballas .

' I 'm going to call you Miss Synchronicity, ' said judge Bruno Tolioli , who received a kiss from Yamaguchi after one dance .
' This was so demanding and so difficult , but you make it look easy .
It 's worthy of the championship for me. '

Taylor 's club-worthy routine earned 27 points and de la Fuente 's Latin-flavored dance collected 26 .

Finishing the season with two perfect scores was 'unbelievable, ' Yamaguchi said : 'We were so thrilled with the dances and the scores , we were like , 'Yes !
' It 's that extra little Tiger Woods fist-pump at the end. '

Pro football star Taylor and actor de la Fuente each said they would n't have changed a thing about their performances , and both are still holding out hope that they might take the 'Dancing ' title .

Yamaguchi has regularly topped the judges scoreboard throughout the season .
Judges ' scores will be combined with viewer votes to determine who takes home the mirrorball trophy on Tuesday night .
