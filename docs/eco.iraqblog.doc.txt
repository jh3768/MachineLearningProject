BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) -- Solar lights in Baghdad ?
I thought I must be hearing things .

Not that the concept of solar energy is novel , but this is after all a war zone and hardly the setting for innovative and environmentally-friendly technology .

Then again , the logic behind using solar lights here has nothing to do with wanting to be eco-friendly .
Its more of a practical solution to keep violence down .

Insurgents use the cover of darkness to plant roadside bombs , creep up and ambush U.S. and Iraqi forces , intimidate and attack the Iraqi population .

Residents , especially in the more volatile neighborhoods in Baghdad , stayed safely indoors once the sun set , trying to avoid the menace of Baghdad 's streets .

We went into Ghazaliye with the U.S. military , a western Baghdad neighborhood , once anAl Qaeda stronghold .

Violence , though much lower than before still exists today .

The day before our patrol , the U.S. lost one of their soldiers to a sniper .
' Careful standing under the lights , keep moving' .

Concertina wire was strewn around , the Iraqi police guided traffic through a checkpoint , blast walls stretched along one side of the road -- a typical Baghdad scene , except that the street was n't pitch black , it was bathed in an orange glow from the solar lights .

And below , one of the nicest grocery stores I have seen in Baghdad .

The owner said he 'd closed shop for over a year and a half when the violence was at its worst .
He re-opened when the lights came on .

There are two solar light projects in Baghdad .
One run by the Iraqi government that 's a larger country-wide effort .
They are your typical solar lights -- panel , battery , and light .

And then there 's the American version that 's something of solar lights a-la-war zone .
Bullet proof glass is meant to protect the lights from insurgents wanting to shoot them out .
Special bolts are meant to keep them from being stolen .

Major Tom Nelson and I joked -- just imagine , Baghdad could end up being the first city powered by solar lights .

Iraq 's power grid is hardly reliable , the sun is .
