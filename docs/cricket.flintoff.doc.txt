Injured Flintoff ruled out of fourth Test - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff will miss the fourth cricket Test against West Indies in Barbados next week through injury .

Flintoff , 31 , has a muscle strain in his right hip and will now be reassessed over the coming days .

He will remain on the tour in the hope that he can prove his fitness for the series finale in Trinidad and the one-day campaign which follows .

' I am obviously very disappointed to miss the Test match and I will be taking the advice of the England medical team that is out here, ' Flintoff told PA Sport .

The England management team hope that rest will aid Flintoff 's recovery from his latest injury setback .
Next Thursday 's penultimate match of the series will be the 53rd Test that he has missed , the vast majority through injury , since making his debut in 1998 .

Flintoff had an anti-inflammatory injection in his troublesome hip midway through the drawn Test in Antigua .
He continued to bowl thereafter , including a stint on the final day as England failed to secure victory by the narrowest of margins , and was dispatched for a scan upon arrival in Barbados on Friday .

Flintoff only began the Test series after recovering from a left side strain incurred in the opening week of the current tour .

Meanwhile , Mahela Jayawardene and Thilan Samaraweera both hit hundreds to lead Sri Lanka to 406-3 on the opening day of the first Test against Pakistan in Karachi .

Jayawardene is unbeaten on 136 -- his 25th Test hundred -- while Samaraweera is 130 not out for his eighth ton after the tourists won the toss and decided to bat .
