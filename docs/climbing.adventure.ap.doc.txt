Climbing adventure on the Russian-Georgian border - CNN.com
ON THE RUSSIAN-GEORGIAN BORDER ( AP ) -- Tears welled in my eyes twice while hiking some of the most beautiful landscapes on the planet -- once in mid-wretch gag and once in awe-struck wonder .

They were unexpected bookends for a journey that only vaguely resembled the trip I planned for myself and my hiking partner Ben Yeomans .
But that 's how adventures often happen in Russia -- unexpectedly , with wonder , bewilderment -- and occasionally even nausea .

In years past , Ben and I together have climbed , hiked , backpacked and canoed mountaintops , deserts , canyons and wilderness rivers .
Never , however , have we traveled through landscapes as severe as the knife edges and wind-swept terrain found along the Russian-Georgian border -- the landscape of the Caucasus Mountains .

And never , for that matter , have we opened a trip in a ramshackle hostel , cups of vodka in hand , eyeing with deep suspicion a plate offered as a welcome dish by our Balkar hosts , who are mountain people and sheepherders by tradition .

It was sheep 's fat wrapped in sheep 's stomach , tied with sinew and boiled until it becomes a gray , wiggly doughnut hole .
Vodka washed the first piece down .
I wretched at the second and tears poured from my eyes , gag-reflex in full operation , vodka out the nose .
Not good .

The Caucasus region is wedged between the Black and Caspian seas with the eponymous mountains climbing skyward in an tectonic crumple .
The Balkars are among dozens of ethnic groups living here who have feuded with one another , or their Russian conquerors , for centuries -- giving the Caucasus a deserved reputation for persistent violence , particularly in Chechnya and on the Russian side .

Most adventurers who come here head to Mount Elbrus , Europe 's highest peak at 18,500 feet .
It has year-round snow pack and glaciers that draw skiers , snowboarders and mountaineers , not to mention weekend tourists who take an aging cable car up to the snow fields , snap a few pictures , then descend to spas , bars , discos and hotels in the valley .

We avoided Elbrus , mainly to avoid other people altogether , but also so that we did n't burden ourselves with heavy mountaineering equipment .

Our starting point was the hostel , called Zhilisu , where we arrived in the fog-shrouded dark after a three-hour ride , having climbed up through an abandoned , post-apocalyptic uranium mine in the back of a car that resembled a 1970s van .
The Russians call it a jeep and it bravely traverses roads that horses might fear to pass .
Out the windows we peered through pea-soup fog and dusk to look hundreds of feet straight down into gullies and ravines .
No guardrails , of course .

More than once , we bounced over a ditch and slammed our heads into the car 's roof .
Our driver smoked incessantly and maneuvered around washouts , while making regular jokes about dying .
Later , at our hostel , faced with a second plate of boiled sheep 's stomach , I too began to wonder about dying .

The morning after , we left Zhilisu on foot .
We explored nearby mineral springs and saw a towering waterfall through jagged cliffs above sending veils of mist into the gorge and the sunlight .

We then climbed southeast past hobbled horses and cows up through a notch toward our first pass -- Eldarbashi .
The washed-browns and October yellows of the grasses and pastures gave way to fields of broken rock .
At the height of the 9,500-foot-high pass , we looked down into the Islamchat river valley , scoured out by erosion that has humbled these mountains for thousands of years .
We pitched our tent on a high bluff as the fog dulled the river 's echoes and closed us off from the world .

The next day , winds pushed us up to the Kyrtykaush Pass , at 10,600 feet , where we found a metal monument marker from the Communist Party 's youth organization , Komsomol , dedicated to native sons of the Caucasus who died in World War II , which Russians call 'The Great Patriotic War. '

On the downward slopes , a herd of horses eyed us warily , then scrambled higher .
At valley 's bottom , the braids of the Kyrtyk River carved a wide swath between two lines of peaks stretching up into glacier and sheer rock .
Upstream we could see decrepit stone-and-timber sheepherders ' camps along with rusting shipping containers marked 'CCCP ' -- Russian for U.S.S.R.. Above us , a figure chased a flock of sheep up over the ridge .
With a sweep of the arm , I ran my fingers over the cloud-swept glaciers , down the river valley , through the flood plain and over the pine tree hillside .

We camped along a stone wall , on the south bank of the river , littered with paper birch and aspen leaves that caught the evening sun .
The next morning , we were spotted by a cow herder with blackened hands , mud-caked rubber boots and a filthy undershirt .
He did n't know what to make of two American backpackers , but he did the neighborly thing for the Balkars : He invited us in for a cup of tea and a smoke of hashish .

We declined .
He then gave us a quick tirade on the state of the world .
' The Soviet Union ; it was a godless country .
' The bitterness was understandable .
Thousands of Balkars were deported from here by Stalin in 1943 , accused of collaboration with the Germans .

He said he 'd been in the pastures all summer and would stay all winter , occasionally making his way home to the Baksan Valley -- just like his grandfather and great-grandfathers did before him .

We followed a road to the valley and met our driver , who took us to the base of a ski area , where we set off for the second part of our journey -- this time almost due south to the border with Georgia .
In spitting snow and fading light , we hopped on a single-chair lift up the south side of Mount Cherget ( 11,300 feet ) and were met by a border guard -- who , like the herder , seemed bemused by our presence but willingly recorded our names and passport numbers .

Later , in the twilight and snow , we pitched our tent on the marshy shores of Lake Donguzorunkel , a basin of brilliant aquamarines , glacial water and minerals fed by two splashing waterfalls .
The clack-clack of hail on the tent drowned out our conversation ; the rumble of glaciers separating and snow packs collapsing into clouds of white kept us awake .

We had hoped to climb farther to a smaller lake over the next ridge , a half-mile from the border .
The guard the previous day had warned that we would n't be allowed to because we were foreigners .
He was right : Despite offers of gorp , chocolate and a gift of maple syrup , two young guards refused to let us go .

Instead we scrambled down and up and down again over sofa-sized boulders that shifted under foot , over green-gray lichen and through alpine scrub .
We passed an old helicopter wreck , 'CCCP ' stamped on the engine block and doors .
And we clamored on tufts of tundra grasses up to a parapet high over the lake , the steep slopes falling away around us .

I stopped and looked out .
Below us , the vivid hues of the lake and echo of waterfalls .
Above us , serrated , snow-swept crags straining up into the rush of clouds .
At their base , wet slides crashing down chutes and gullies into alluvial fans of snow , ice silt and rock .

It felt like we were watching geological time unfold before our eyes , epochs and eons sweeping past like clouds that lick the mountaintops and dissolve .

We were very , very small travelers passing but only briefly through an enormous world of almost unfathomable beauty .

I closed my eyes as tears again welled up .

If you go .. .

Tips : Russia 's North Caucasus is a volatile , corrupt and mind-boggling place , a mix of mindsets that is one part holdover Soviet bureaucracy , one part clan-driven , xenophobic distrust , one part anti-terrorist police policies .
The rewards are immense if you have a thick skin , willingness to grease a palm or two , and the patience to weather capricious bureaucracy .

Timing : For trekking or hiking , September is the best time to go , after the crowds have gone and the weather is cooler .
July and August are peak hiking and climbing months .
Be prepared for long lines of tourists if you are climbing Mount Elbrus .
For skiing , snowboarding or ice climbing , late winter from February on is ideal .

Visas : Most foreigners will need a visa , obtained well in advance , to enter Russia , and will need to register with authorities upon arrival and have permits for visiting Mount Elbrus , the park and border area .
You may want to consult with a travel agent experienced in Russian travel .
U.S. State Department recommendations are at http : //travel.state.gov/travel/travel_1744.html .

Getting there : Most routes involve flying to Moscow 's Sheremyetevo or Domodedevo airports ; then to Mineralniye Vodi , the city nearest Elbrus ; then a three-hour drive south to the Baksan River , the jumping off point for Elbrus .
