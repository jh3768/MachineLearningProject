Christmas cakes, cathedrals and communism  - CNN.com
DRESDEN , Germany ( CNN Traveller ) -- A group of middle-aged Germans is standing in a room full of underwear .
No , this is n't the preamble to a joke .
The location is the DDR ( Deutsche Demokratische Republik ) Museum in the eastern city of Dresden --- an Aladdin 's cave of Ostalgie , the term coined to refer to nostalgia for the days of the communist system .

One of the men points to a substantial corset-type undergarment and turns to his wife .

''Your mum used to have some like that. '

' She did not ! '

' She did .
She used to hang them on the washing line. '

' No she did n't ! '

A brief pause .
The man whispers loudly to a friend next to him .
' She 's probably still got them , you know. '

Everyone roars with laughter and the group moves on to the next room .

I presume these people had lived in the former East Germany , but unable to distinguish one regional German accent from another , I could n't tell you for sure .
The thing is , many of the objects in the museum are probably recognizable to anyone who lived through the 1970s or 1980s .
They are also a reminder , perhaps , that the DDR did export to the West --- in a room full of cameras I spotted my first SLR , a Praktica ---made in Dresden .

If you want any in-depth insight into the machinations of the communist system and what it was like to live under it , however , you will not find it here .
Instead , you will pass through room after room of everyday objects and reconstructed interiors , some of them intriguing , but often only in the way a reconstruction of your grandparents ' house might be --- spindly furniture , heavy sideboards , excessive ornaments , pictures of Lenin... ( OK , your grandparents probably did n't have that ) .

In among the bric-a-brac are displays of DDR uniforms , most rather curiously lacking in footwear , and an intriguing room dedicated to the realities of the days immediately after the end of World War II .
Here you can see a literal rendition of swords into plow shares , with cooking pots and colanders made from steel helmets and cups and bowls carved from spent shell cases .

There 's a particular poignancy to the display because Dresden suffered so heavily in World War II .
Between February 13 and 15 , 1945 the city was extensively bombed and an estimated 25,000 people were killed .
Among many other buildings that were destroyed was the Baroque Frauenkirche ( Church of Our Lady ) , whose huge , sandstone-built dome had been an integral part of the historic city 's skyline .

Rebuilding began in 1994 and the church finally reopened in 2005 --- the task having cost &euro ; 130 million .
Some 3,800 stones , many of which had lain untouched where they had fallen over 50 years previously , were incorporated into the new fabric and dot the honey-colored facade with dark reminders of the cost of war --- at least until their newer brethren change color with exposure to the air .

Inside , the Frauenkirche is spectacular --- the Baroque recreated in all its glory with light , air and pastel colors providing a marked contrast to the hushed gloom of many ecclesiastical buildings .
The eye is drawn initially upwards to the great cupola then , via windowed galleries and the gleaming steel pipes , golf leaf and yellow plasterwork of the church organ , to the cluster of figures around the altar .
The depiction of Christ survived the bombing , and when recovered from the wreckage it was said to be flecked with molten metal that had dripped down from the roof --- the droplets looking like tears on his face .

Over the festive season the Frauenkirche is a central part of life in Dresden , with regular services , concerts and recitals .
It is also a recurring motif amid the city 's famous Christmas markets --- the largest of which , the Striezelmarkt , lies just north of the church on a large square known as the Altmarkt .

Christmas markets are big business these days .
Stall after brightly lit stall tempts locals and foreigners alike with traditional toys , handmade decorations , gingerbread , Gl&uuml ; hwein and --- particularly in Dresden 's case --- Stollen .

The city lays claim to being the capital of the famous , sugar-dusted fruit-cake , traditionally shaped like a baby in swaddling clothes , with each bakery having an individual numbered gold label they proudly attach to their creations .

At the Grundmann stall in the Striezelmarkt , veteran Stollen master Frank Ludolphy stands surrounded by specimens of all shapes and sizes .
What he does not know about this famous cake is n't worth knowing --- he has been baking them for more than 50 years .

' We put in candied lemon and orange , nutmeg , sweet and bitter almonds and raisins that have been soaked in rum --- added as the last ingredient so they do n't darken the mix .
It 's all a very traditional process .
In theory , you would n't start baking Stollen until 31 October , but that 's changed a bit now with some people starting to bake in August. '

Over the years , though , ingredients have not always been easy to come by , he adds .
' In the final three years of the DDR we could n't get candied oranges , so we used candied tomatoes instead --- cut up and soaked in lemon juice .
Our mission was to create a Stollen that tasted like a Stollen so we did everything to achieve that .
We did n't want to let our customers down , you see. '

While Ostalgie may be flourishing , surely few of those who today enjoy the memories at Dresden 's DDR museum would feel nostalgic for such eccentric ingredients in their favorite Christmas treat .
