Work from home in your pajamas - CNN.com
Freelance work has quickly become a booming industry in its own right .

Workers who do n't want to belong to the daily grind and who want more control of their careers often opt to work for themselves .

Consultants , writers , IT specialists and experts in pretty much any field you can imagine are freelancing these days .

A recent MSN-CareerBuilder Zogby poll found many workers are eager to explore freelancing if the right situation presents itself .
Thirty percent of respondents would freelance if they could make as much money as they currently do .
An additional 17 percent want to freelance in order to be their own boss .

What exactly do they do ?
These professionals do contract work with clients , either on a project-by-project basis or for a certain time period .
They can take as many or as few clients as they want or have time for .

In a tightening economy , many companies do n't have the budgets to hire full-time personnel , but they do have the funds to hire a freelancer for short-term projects .

For this reason , many people start their freelance careers during sluggish economic conditions .
Others use freelancing as a way to make ends meet until they can find a permanent position .

Freedom and flexibility

Although freelancing means you do n't have traditional employer-provided benefits , such as a 401 ( k ) , you do have plenty of other perks -- some that might be hard to leave .

Kay Paumier , for example , did n't intend to make a career of freelancing .
The PR agency she was working for closed in 1987 and , while looking for a full-time position , she found work .
Twenty years later she still freelances in public relations and writing for her company , Communications Plus .

' Many people freelance to have the flexibility to raise their families or to take care of aging parents , for example, ' she says .
' Others love the opportunity to set their hours -- within reason , work in their pajamas , avoid corporate politics and have more control over their time. '

Kelly Dinoff , a marketing consultant at Sonance Communications , had a similar experience .
She started freelancing after the September 11 attacks helped burst the technology bubble and decided to stay due to the flexible hours .

' As a mother of two , I 'm able to pursue my professional aspirations while having the flexibility to take time off for family obligations and to be an active participant in my children 's lives. '

Discipline and drive

As anyone who has worked from home for even one day can tell you , the ability to do business in your pajamas is pure bliss .
It 's also dangerous for your inner slacker .

No one 's standing over your shoulder to make sure you 're doing your job .
When you 're freelancing , you 've got to be the one looking over your own shoulder making sure everything is on track .

Of course , that does n't mean you do n't work hard , either .
You might end up working harder because you are the face of your business .
While you get all the kudos for a job well done , you get all the blame when someone 's not happy .

In a business where word-of-mouth brings you clients and keeps them away , you ca n't afford to have a reputation as anything but a hard worker .

One way to maintain high-quality work is to set goals for yourself as if you were still being reviewed by a manager every quarter .
Like Dinoff , you 'll soon realize that freelancing still allows you to form a professional network and grow in the field .
You 're not completely alone in the industry .

' In the course of my freelance career , I 've worked with other female professionals who have made the same move to freelancing for flexibility, ' she says .
' Despite our less than 40-hour workweeks , we 'll still able to collaborate on complex projects , produce great work and maintain successful customer relationships. '
