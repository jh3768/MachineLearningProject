Double-booked at the Days Inn - CNN.com
( Tribune Media Services ) -- Chan Hoe Yip booked rooms in Bakersfield , California , and Williams , Arizona , through the Days Inn Web site .
Then again , maybe he did n't .
The reservation ends up being two nights in Bakersfield and none in Williams , and now Yip is being told there 's no refund for the extra night .
Is Yip the victim of a bad Web site ?

Q : I 'm disappointed with Days Inn 's 'no cancellation ' policy reply and frustrated by its indifference to my predicament .
I hope you can help me .

I 'm visiting the United States next week , and I made two separate hotel reservations .
The first was for a night at a Days Inn in Bakersfield , California , and the second was for a night at a Days Inn in Williams , Arizona .

Instead of generating a reservation for each property , the hotel 's Web site gave me two confirmations in Bakersfield .
Since Days Inn has a 'no cancellation ' policy , my credit card was charged and I could n't get my money back .

I 've e-mailed Days Inn , since I feel I 'm a victim of its bad online system .
I want a refund on the second reservation .
It refuses to help .
I think Days Inn should be more understanding , do n't you ?

-- Chan Hoe Yip , Singapore

A : No question about it , Days Inn should have a little heart -- especially if this was a Web site glitch .

The Days Inn Web site can be confusing .
I tried to book a room at the Bakersfield property and wandered through multiple screens in search of information about refunds .
Instead of saying up front whether a particular room was nonrefundable , it presented me with a boilerplate notice that 'any required deposit or pre-payment will be charged to ( my ) card immediately .
' Its terms and conditions were equally vague .

I do n't know if Days Inn is trying to pull a fast one -- I 'll leave that for you to decide -- but I find its online reservations system to be problematic in many ways .
For example , it does n't include an estimate of the total price , instead offering a deceptively low 'base rate ' and warning that , 'local surcharges or service charges are not included in the total room rate .
' You do n't get to actually see that information until you type in your credit card information .
Nor do you find out if the room is refundable until then , as far as I can tell .

Also , Days Inn pre-checks boxes that sign you up for 'special offers ' from the hotel chain and promotional offers from its partners .
That kind of pre-checking -- assuming that you are interested in getting the company 's junk mail and depending on you to uncheck the boxes if you are n't -- is generally frowned upon by the online community .

I asked Days Inn to take a look at your reservation .
It determined that you had made a mistake when you booked your rooms .
While that may be true , I think the Days Inn site has what designers might call 'usability ' issues that make these errors easy to commit .
I think it should refund your second room .

If you ever run into this problem again , do n't just e-mail the hotel chain .
Try sending a message directly to the hotel ( email addresses are listed on the Days Inn site ) .
Work the phones , too .
Applying pressure from all sides is perhaps the most effective way of getting your money back quickly .

Days Inn recommended that next time , you book your room using its toll-free number , which , given the fact that you live in Singapore , might not be practical advice .
Even though it believes you erred , a representative from Days Inn corporate contacted the management of the independently owned and operated Days Inn property in Bakersfield , which agreed to issue credit for the room .
