The pictures that horrified America - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- World War II was over , but as the 1940s gave way to the 1950s , a new evil lurked in the land .

It attracted a youthful audience -- boys , mostly -- who fell victim to its colorful images , dripping in red , and gave money to its purveyors .

Authorities took notice .
The United States had a new menace , they said , one whose name started with 'c ' and whose first syllable rhymed with 'bomb. '

Comic books .

' The country was fixated on this, ' said David Hajdu , author of the recently released 'The Ten-Cent Plague ' ( Farrar , Straus &amp ; Giroux ) , a history of the era .

These were n't just any comic books , the ones filled with the derring-do of superheroes .
These had names such as 'Tales from the Crypt, ' 'Shock SuspenStories ' and 'Justice Traps the Guilty, ' and they told stories of crime and horror .
Their cover images included alluring women ( often in low-cut outfits ) , decaying corpses and spooky , murky swamps .

Hajdu , who wrote 'Positively Fourth Street ' about the early-'60s folk music scene , observes that when we think of postwar pop-cultural rebellion , what comes to mind is rock ' n ' roll and Marlon Brando .
But comic books , he notes , came first .
Hundreds of millions sold every month , at 10 cents a throw .

' Everybody read comic books .
They were the most popular form of entertainment in America, ' he said .

The fact that such entertainment was primarily aimed at children and teens raised the ire of authorities , including social scientists , newspaper columnists and political leaders .
These works , they believed , were causing crime and degeneracy .
They had to be stopped .

Towns hosted bonfires to rid themselves of comics ; congressional hearings about the issue helped burnish the image of Tennessee 's Estes Kefauver , who had led hearings against organized crime .

Comic books had been attracting concern since they were introduced in the 1930s -- and superheroes were n't immune .
Figures such as children 's author Sterling North and a Catholic bishop , John Francis Noll , protested the medium as glorifying crime and corrupting youngsters .
The fervor dulled during World War II but came back with a vengeance afterwards as news focused on an alleged increase in juvenile delinquency .

The anti-comics movement really caught fire with the work of psychiatrist Frederic Wertham , who wrote a book , 'Seduction of the Innocent, ' linking comics with delinquency .

In recent decades , Wertham has become a figure of mockery for his theories ( he called the relationship between Batman and Robin 'like a wish-dream of two homosexuals living together ' ) , but Hajdu says he was n't a cardboard villain .
He was committed to working with minorities -- he ran a free clinic in Harlem -- and he genuinely cared about young people .

' He was misguided and used utterly fallacious methods , but what he was getting at was understandable, ' Hajdu said , though adding that 'he did much more harm than good. '

Among Wertham 's adversaries was William M. Gaines , son of comics pioneer Max Gaines and the owner of EC Comics .
Thanks to a staff of innovative writers and artists -- including Al Feldstein , Harvey Kurtzman , Wally Wood , Will Elder and Jack Davis -- and a deep investment in the crime and horror genres , Gaines revived a moribund EC , making it one of the business 's most successful companies .
Its titles , including 'Crypt ' and 'SuspenStories, ' were both graphic and groundbreaking .

' EC Comics out-bloodied them all but also used social commentary and had a lighter quality of gruesome art, ' said Bill Svitavsky , a history professor at Florida 's Rollins College who teaches a course on American graphic publishing with his colleague Julian Chambliss .

' EC had statements about racism and conformity to small-town values, ' Chambliss said .
Many of EC 's staffers , he observes , were World War II veterans who 'd seen their share of violence , and their art -- if graphic -- gave their stories the ring of truth .
( Author Grant Geissman put together a collection of EC 's work , 'Foul Play !
' ( HarperDesign ) , in 2005 .

However , the keepers of the boundaries pushed back , Svitavsky says .
In those Red Scare times , 'Adults were fearful [ of works that questioned the establishment .
] ... Comic books were believed to be an underestimated , unpatriotic tool to get at kids. '

The children , Hajdu says , illustrated the tension of the times .
Some had tried to hide their collections ; others had energetically taken part in comic-book burnings .
He interviewed many of them , now grown-ups in their 60s or 70s .
' It was harrowing to listen to them, ' he said .

The issues came to a head at the subcommittee hearings on juvenile delinquency , which began in late 1953 .
Among the witnesses were Gaines and Wertham , who 'looked as if he had come straight from doing scientific work, ' Hajdu writes .
The comics ' fate was sealed when Gaines , in televised testimony , attempted to defend a 'Crime SuspenStories ' cover , depicting the hand of a killer clutching a woman 's severed head , as 'good taste .
' Audiences were shocked ; opinion leaders raged .

A comics publishers ' association put together the Comics Code Authority , which banned the words 'horror ' and 'terror ' from comic books .
Sales plunged , dozens of artists lost their jobs , and comic books did n't make a comeback for years .

' Everybody was cautious in the '60s, ' noted Ron Goulart , author of 'Good Girl Art, ' a history of female images in comic books .
He credits the horror-crime scare with 'probably help [ ing ] resurrect superheroes, ' particularly the new breed created by Marvel Comics in the '60s .

The horror and crime books were also reflective of a changing world .
Film historians have observed that the heyday of film noir was in the late '40s , and it was n't long before Brando , James Dean , Elvis Presley and many others were busting boundaries in other genres .

Gaines was a part of that , Hajdu observes .
There was one comic , a humor book , he had protected .
He made it a magazine to save it from the Comics Code Authority and refused to accept advertising .

In time , the magazine became one of the most influential publications of the 20th century , inspiring generations to question authority and mocking the pieties of politics , religion and popular culture .

It was called Mad .
