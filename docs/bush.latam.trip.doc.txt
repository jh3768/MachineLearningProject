Bush trip may have started healing Latin America rift - CNN.com
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- You can take the president out of the Beltway , but you ca n't keep the Beltway away from the president , as the president himself learned on his recent trip to Latin America .

President Bush visited five countries in seven days in an effort to convince the region 's leaders that -- contrary to what some critics say -- he has n't neglected the region .

Did it work ?
Time , as they say , will tell .
Time , as they say , will tell , but many believe Mister Bush took an important first step .

Here was the president of the United States venturing into a new political scenario , meeting with left leaning counterparts in Brazil and Uruguay , who want a stronger relationship with the United States .

Mister Bush set a different tone He publicly reached out to Brazil 's Luis Inacio Lula da Silva and Uruguay 's Tabar e Vasquez as equals , visited troubled allies like Alvaro Uribe of Colombia and Oscar Berger of Guatemala and spent two days in Mexico , his closest ally in the hemisphere -- and not only geographically .

He heard out Mexican President Felipe Calderon on issues such as immigration , the war on drugs and free trade .

For seven days Bush was able to get off the subject of Iraq , although the war followed him on the trip .
Throughout , he ignored tautsn from Venezuala 's President Hugo Chavez , even though reporters asked him to respond at almost every stop .

At first , back home brushfires in California absorbed the attention of the U.S. media , and then the controversy over the firing of U.S. attorneys by the Justice Department , all while images of violent anti-Bush protests in the countries the president visited , and Chavez 's parallel anti-Bush campaign , filled U.S. TV screens .

Did the relentless news cycle diminish the trip ?
Not really .
The president 's trip received ample coverage in Latin America , the target audience .
The president said many things people wanted to hear , like his acknowledgement of U.S. responsibility in the flourishing drug trade with the simple observation that American consumers flush with cash give life to a narcotics supply system , with terrible consequences for the region where drugs are produced .

He again promised to do all he can to promote comprehensive immigration reform , although it 's up to the Democratic-controlled Congress to hammer out legislation on the matter .

He repeated Latin Americans how compassionate and generous Americans were with $ 1.6 billion in aid to the region last year .
It was a message meant for two publics : the U.S. taxpayers , so they know where their money is spent , and people on the receiving end , who may have been asking what the United States has been doing for them lately .

The trip produced a succession of images that show President Bush in another light :

Attending a press conference where a portrait of Simon Bolivar stared at Presidents Uribe and Bush , providing a reminder that Bolivar 's legacy of liberating five south American countries from Spain is not exclusive to Chavez and the revolution he tailored after the Venezuelan hero .

Heaping lettuce and walking through Santa Cruz de Balantya to applause , a town rebuilt after the 1976 earthquake in Guatemala with the United States ' help , and kissing women and children .

Meeting with Afro-Colombians in Bogota and hearing about their plight .

Joking in Uruguay about how he and Vasquez are both 'Tejanos, ' a running joke in Uruguay , but not clear to everyone .
Bush , although born in Connecticut , considers himself a Texan .
Vasquez was born in the 'Teja ' neighborhood of Montevideo , so , yes , they are both 'Tejanos. '

What will come from this trip ?
Too soon to tell .
It 's up to Congress to decide the fate of immigration reform and free-trade agreements with Colombia and Peru , among other areas of interest to the region , but it wo n't be an easy task .
Those issues cause divisions between those who support and reject free trade , and the many visions of what comprehensive immigration reform should be -- will there or wo n't there be a 700-mile fence along the U.S.-Mexico Border ?

The border fence proposal is among many topics of discussion in Latin America that add to a rejection of U.S. foreign policy , with the war in Iraq as the main point of contention .
Though the war is thousands of miles away it stirs passions in the region , so much that Bush is highly unpopular down south .

This trip is a first step .
The real challenge is figuring out if it was taken at the right moment , or if as many experts predicted , it might prove to be too little , too late .
