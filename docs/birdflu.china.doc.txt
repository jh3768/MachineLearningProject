80,000 birds to die in Hong Kong flu scare - CNN.com
HONG KONG , China ( CNN ) -- Authorities in Hong Kong ordered about 80,000 chickens killed Tuesday after discovering dozens of birds had died of bird flu at a farm in the territory .

The order requires all chickens within a 3 kilometer ( 2-mile ) radius of the farm where the dead chickens were discovered Monday to be culled , said Dr. York Chow , Hong Kong 's food and health secretary .

' We have discovered up to 60 dead chickens in that farm .
After a series of tests , we have confirmed this morning that the chickens did die from the H5 virus, ' Chow told reporters .

One other farm is affected by the order , he said .

Health officials worldwide have long feared a major human outbreak of the H5N1 flu virus , which has infected numerous bird species in Asia , Europe and Africa .
The disease has been passed from poultry to humans in some cases , resulting in more than 200 deaths since 2003 .

Human-to-human transmission of avian flu is rare , but officials worry it could mutate and become a deadly pandemic .
