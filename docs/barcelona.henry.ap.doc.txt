Henry set for striking role at Barcelona - CNN.com
ST. ANDREWS , Scotland ( AP ) -- Barcelona striker Thierry Henry believes new coach Pep Guardiola 's plans to restore him to his favored center forward position will bring him more goals this season .

Henry had a relatively disappointing first season in Spain after then coach Frank Rijkaard played him on the left-wing , where he often had to cover in defense for left-back Eric Abidal .

' Last year , I played on the left side and it was harder to score goals because I had to help Abidal to defend, ' Henry said at Barcelona 's pre-season training camp in Scotland .

Playing mostly at center forward , Henry scored 226 goals in all competitions for Arsenal to become the Premier League club 's all-time leading scorer .

' This is a new year and I want to score goals, ' he said .
' My goal for this season is to score .
Last year , not playing well , I scored 19 goals and I hope to do more this season if I do n't have any problems with injuries. '

The 30-year-old France striker is unconcerned about his place in the Barcelona lineup despite speculation the club is vying to sign former Arsenal teammate Emmanuel Adebayor .

' That does n't bother me .
The same happened at Arsenal ... the coach always bought great players and when you are at a great club like Barcelona , you know this is normal, ' Henry said .
