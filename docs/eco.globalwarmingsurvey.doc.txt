Surveyed scientists agree global warming is real - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- Human-induced global warming is real , according to a recent U.S. survey based on the opinions of 3,146 scientists .
However there remains divisions between climatologists and scientists from other areas of earth sciences as to the extent of human responsibility .

Against a backdrop of harsh winter weather across much of North America and Europe , the concept of rising global temperatures might seem incongruous .

However the results of the investigation conducted at the end of 2008 reveal that vast majority of the Earth scientists surveyed agree that in the past 200-plus years , mean global temperatures have been rising and that human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures .

The study released today was conducted by academics from the University of Illinois , who used an online questionnaire of nine questions .
The scientists approached were listed in the 2007 edition of the American Geological Institute 's Directory of Geoscience Departments .

Two questions were key : Have mean global temperatures risen compared to pre-1800s levels , and has human activity been a significant factor in changing mean global temperatures ?

About 90 percent of the scientists agreed with the first question and 82 percent the second .

The strongest consensus on the causes of global warming came from climatologists who are active in climate research , with 97 percent agreeing humans play a role .

Petroleum geologists and meteorologists were among the biggest doubters , with only 47 percent and 64 percent , respectively , believing in human involvement .

' The petroleum geologist response is not too surprising , but the meteorologists ' is very interesting, ' said Peter Doran associate professor of earth and environmental sciences at the University of Illinois at Chicago , and one of the survey 's authors .

' Most members of the public think meteorologists know climate , but most of them actually study very short-term phenomenon. '

However , Doran was not surprised by the near-unanimous agreement by climatologists .

' They 're the ones who study and publish on climate science .
So I guess the take-home message is , the more you know about the field of climate science , the more you 're likely to believe in global warming and humankind 's contribution to it .

' The debate on the authenticity of global warming and the role played by human activity is largely nonexistent among those who understand the nuances and scientific basis of long-term climate processes, ' said Doran .
