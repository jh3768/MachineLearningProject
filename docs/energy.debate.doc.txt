Energy compromise offers test for Obama, McCain - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- Barack Obama and John McCain play up their willingness to reach across the aisle , and now that there 's a bipartisan energy compromise on the table , they have the opportunity to put their words to the test .

A group of Republican and Democratic senators dubbed the 'Gang of 10 ' has put forth a compromise to break the stalemate on energy legislation .

The senators say their plan will lower gas prices , reduce the dependence on foreign oil and strengthen the U.S. economy .

' This is not a Democratic issue , or a Republican issue , it is an issue that affects all of us .
I am committed to working with all of my colleagues in a bipartisan manner to resolve the energy crisis .
The time for delay is over .
We need to act now, ' said Sen. Kent Conrad , who is leading the proposal .

The proposal includes concessions for both Democrats and Republicans , but compromising carries risks for the White House hopefuls .

Both candidates have been vocal in their support for and opposition to some key parts of the energy compromise .

The major components of the proposal include :

Expanding drilling opportunities off the East coast and Gulf of Mexico , which pleases Republicans

Keeping a ban on drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska , a concession to Democrats

Repealing a tax break for oil companies that Democrats have long called for

Putting billions toward producing more alternative-fuel vehicles , in part paid for by the oil and gas industry

But backing the compromise carries the risk of angering some supporters of both candidates .

' I think for Obama ... the problem is drilling and is alienating environmental activists .
For McCain , the problem is alienating anti-tax advocates , who are already sort of frustrated with him on some level, ' said John Mercurio , a political analyst .

McCain has been pushing for offshore drilling , saying it 's a 'vital part ' of dealing with the energy challenge .

' We have to drill here and drill now -- not wait and see whether there 's areas to explore , not wait and see whether there 's a package that needs to be put together , but drill here and drill now, ' the presumptive Republican nominee said Monday in Lafayette Hill , Pennsylvania .

Obama has opposed new offshore drilling , but he now says he would consider it if it were part of a larger strategy to lower energy costs .

He supports repealing the tax break for oil companies and he 's tried to paint McCain as a candidate who is 'in the pocket ' of big oil corporations .

Obama advocates a windfall profits tax on big oil corporations that would be used to provide a $ 1,000 rebate to people struggling with high energy costs .

The Democratic hopeful said he supports some of the proposals in the Gang of 10 compromise , but he said he remains skeptical of the drilling provisions .

' Like all compromises , this one has its drawbacks, ' Obama said Monday in Lansing , Michigan .
' It includes a limited amount of new offshore drilling , and while I still do n't believe that 's a particularly meaningful short-term or long-term solution , I am willing to consider it if it 's necessary to actually pass a comprehensive plan .

' I am not interested in making the perfect the enemy of the good -- particularly since there 's so much good in this compromise that would actually reduce our dependence on foreign oil. '

The 'Gang of 10 ' includes Conrad , D-North Dakota ; Saxby Chambliss , R-Georgia ; John Thune , R-South Dakota ; Lindsey Graham , R-South Carolina ; Blanche Lincoln , D-Arkansas ; Mary Landrieu , D-Louisiana ; Johnny Isakson , R-Georgia ; Bob Corker , R-Tennessee ; Mark Pryor , D-Arkansas ; and Ben Nelson , D-Nebraska .

The presidential candidates have plenty of time to push their proposals on the campaign trail .
Congress adjourned Friday for its annual 5-week recess and wo n't pick up the legislation until it returns in September .

Meanwhile in the House , Republicans have staged a revolt and are demanding that Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi call the House into session to vote on its version of the energy bill .

Republicans refused to leave the House floor Friday and began five hours of speeches protesting Democratic energy policies immediately after the House was dismissed .
The speeches picked up again Monday morning and Republicans have pledged to keep up the effort .

Democrats have called the Republicans ' defiance a political stunt , but Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana , who 's leading the energy protest , said 'it 's not a stunt , it 's a feat. '

Most Americans support an increase in offshore oil drilling , but the public is split over whether drilling would lead to lower gas prices next year , according to a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll out last week .

According to the poll , 69 percent favor offshore drilling and 30 percent oppose it .

Just over half -- 51 percent -- think the drilling would lower gas prices next year , while 49 percent say it would not .

The survey is based on interviews with 1,041 adult Americans conducted by telephone on July 27-29 .
It carries a margin of error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points .
