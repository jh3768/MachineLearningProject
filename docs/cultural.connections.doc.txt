Stinky cheese, chats all part of connecting - CNN.com
( Tribune Media Services ) -- I used to be put off by European sophisticates , so into their fine wine and stinky cheese and even the 'terroir ' that created it all .
But now I love being a cultural bumpkin .

Sure , I 'm simple .
I was raised thinking cheese is orange and comes in the shape of the bread .
Slap it on ... voila ... cheese sandwich .
Over in Europe , cheese is not orange nor the shape of the bread .
In France alone you could eat a different cheese every day of the year .
And it would n't surprise me if people did .
These people are passionate about their cheese .

I love it when my favorite restaurateur in Paris , Marie-Alice , takes me shopping in the morning and shows me what 's going to be on the menu that night .
She steers me into her favorite cheese shop .
It 's a festival of mold .
Picking up the moldiest , gooiest wad , Marie-Alice takes a deep whiff , and groans ecstatically , 'Oh , Rick , smell zees cheese .
It smells like zee feet of angels. '

I 'm her wide-eyed student .
It 's fun to be on the receiving end of all that cultural , gastronomic and regional pride .
I see it as a learning opportunity .
Thankfully people are sophisticated about different things , and when we have the opportunity to connect , it can be good for all .

While my father does n't know much about cheese , he is sophisticated about pianos .
I remember going to Vienna on those early trips with my dad .
He was a piano tuner in Seattle , and he imported fine pianos .
Back in the late '60s and early '70s I 'd join him on a flight to Vienna .
He 'd take me to the Bosendorfer factory where the world 's finest pianos were made .
I remember thinking they were n't manufactured -- they were birthed .

Touring the factory , which fills a former monastery , we learned the procedure for aging the wood , and why the imported felt was made from the wool of a certain kind of sheep .
In former monks ' cells , the workers each proudly produced two pianos per year .
The result of this lovingly labor-intensive production process : each piano had its own personality .
Bringing that Old World quality to the New World was the joy of my dad 's work .

While this old-time quality is gone , a casualty of our mass-produced modern world , perhaps having witnessed it is one of the reasons I 'm enthusiastic about sharing the fine points of European culture .
Bosendorfers may no longer be produced with such loving care .
But , thankfully , the cheese still smells like zee feet of angels .

On the road you meet people you 'd never meet at home -- people who highlight those cultures .
I meet a greater variety of interesting people in two months in Europe than I encounter in an entire year in America .
At home , we surround ourselves with people like ourselves .
It 's just the normal thing to do .
We shop , worship and play where people like us do the same things .

One of my favorite countries is Ireland -- not because of its sights , but because of its people .
In Ireland I have the sensation that I actually understand a foreign language .
People there have the gift of gab -- for them , it 's an art form .
I think the Irish are such engaging conversationalists because , even if they do n't speak Gaelic ( the poetic old Irish language ) , many think in it .

More Irish speak Gaelic than many travelers realize .
Often when you step into a shop , you do n't know that the locals were speaking to each other in Gaelic .
They turn to you , without missing a beat , and speak in English .
When you step away , they slip right back into their language .

I love traveling in a Gaeltacht , as Gaelic-speaking regions are called .
These are national preserves for the traditional culture -- where the government decides , even at the expense of good business , that they will subsidize the continued existence of the Irish language because it 's part of their heritage .
It 's very hard for me to keep my busy itinerary in a Gaeltacht because people are so charming and they 've got all the time in the world to talk .

I was deep into one conversation with an old-timer when I asked him , 'Were you born here ?
' And he said , 'No , 't was about five miles down the road .
' Later on I asked him , 'Have you lived here all your life ?
' He winked and said , 'Not yet. '

When I 'm doing a tour , writing a guidebook , or filming a TV show , if I 'm not interacting with people , it 's going to be a flat experience .
Cultural bumpkin or worldly sophisticate , if you want rich travel experiences , you 've got to connect .
