Monke leads as Sorenstam slips off pace  - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- Annika Sorenstam faces an uphill battle to sign off on her remarkable career with a victory as she slipped to a three-over-par 75 to fall four shots behind third round leader Anja Monke of Germany in the Dubai Ladies Masters .

The legendary Swede looked poised for her 90th tournament victory when she led at halfway in an event she has made her own with victories in the two previous stagings .

But she struggled on the Majlis course of the Emirates Golf Club on Saturday , carding a solitary birdie and four bogeys .

Monke , who won the first-ever title in France earlier this season , added a four-under 68 that gave her a two-shot lead on nine-under 207 in the final event of the 2008 European Ladies Tour .

Italian Veronica Zorzi might have been joint leader but was penalized two shots when her ball moved on the 15th green after addressing .

She was tied for second place with Denmark 's Iben Tinning on seven-under 209 .

Swede Sophie Gustafson shot the day 's best round of six-under 66 to move up to tied fourth place on six-under 210 alongside English veteran Laura Davies .

But all the attention focused on 38-year-old Sorenstam , who announced in May she would be bringing her professional career to a halt for family and business reasons .

Despite still suffering from the affects of a flu bug and her poor third round , Sorenstam remained optimistic of a third straight win in Dubai .

' I 've done it before .
I just have to come out tomorrow , be fresh and get off to a good start and get some good momentum .
I am not giving up by any chance .
I just walked off the course disappointed , but I will be ready for tomorrow, ' she told the official Web site of the European Ladies Tour .

Monke said she had mixed emotions about possibly denying Sorenstam a fairytale goodbye victory .
' She is , of course , one of my idols and the idol of any girl who touches a golf club, ' she said .

' She has done many , many things for women 's golf and I think without her we would n't be here today. '

Gwladys Nocera of France , who leads the European money list , continued to improve with a one-under 71 to move into red figures overall .
