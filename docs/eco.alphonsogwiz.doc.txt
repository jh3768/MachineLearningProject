Granny loves her G-Wiz - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- Transplanted from the U.S to London , Phyllis Earl knows how to get somebody 's attention .

I asked the 74-year old grandmother to take me for a ride in her G-Wiz , a tiny two-door electric vehicle that qualifies her for significant transportation cost discounts in a growing number of London neighborhoods .

As she drove the car out onto a major London roadway , feisty Phyllis told me about differences between the United States and English systems for renewing driver 's licenses once you hit 70-years old .

' In the States , whenever you renew your license you have to have an eye test .
Well , here [ in England ] , they sort of just take your word for it, ' she says .

As if the prospect of riding in this Coke-can-of-a-car was n't nerve wracking enough , now I 'm wondering if Phyllis - who moved to London in the 1960 's -- has anything close to 20/20 vision .

Fear not on both counts , Phyllis handles her G-Wiz with the skills of Lewis Hamilton on a Formula One track .
Only a lot slower .

Like many electric battery powered vehicles , the G-Wiz is n't going to set any land speed records or crash into anything at a high speed in London .

But it is tail-pipe emissions free , and as Phyllis told me , she ditched her Ford Fiesta for an electric vehicle almost two years ago -- and says she would n't think of going back to a gas/petrol-powered car .

Electric vehicle enthusiasts say with London 's notorious traffic congestion issues , there 's not much opportunity to put pedal to the metal anyways... an electric vehicle , Phyllis says is ideal for taking her grandkids around town , running errands and visiting friends in London .

To encourage more people like Phyllis to go green , a growing number of local London government councils are offering great perks to electric vehicle owners .

In London 's Westminster Council -- for about a $ 150/year fee , Phyllis gets free parking , a free pass from London 's congestion charges , and free access to electric vehicle recharging posts -- called Juice Points .

Westminster Council is installing Juice Points across the London borough to make it easier for electric vehicle owners to 'top up ' their car batteries .

At least four other London councils are following Westminster 's lead , it seems Juice Points may soon pop up all over Greater London .

No surprise then that when Phyllis heard about the electric car incentive program , she wrote a letter to her local councilman requesting a Juice Point be put in her neighborhood .

And in a city where proper customer service , frankly , is elusive -- Westminster Council listened....installing a Juice Point around the corner from Phyllis ' home .
