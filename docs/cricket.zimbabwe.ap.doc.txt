England cricket chiefs ostracize Zimbabwe  - CNN.com
LONDON , England ( AP ) -- The England and Wales Cricket Board on Wednesday severed all bilateral ties with Zimbabwe 's cricket authorities after British Prime Minister Gordon Brown insisted the team should be banned from entering the country .

The announcements ahead of next summer 's Twenty20 World Cup and tour matches in England echoed Cricket South Africa 's imposition of sporting sanctions , following recent violence in the African nation .

Zimbabwe president Robert Mugabe has faced a growing international outcry as he tries to extend his nearly three-decade rule .

' The ECB deplores the position in Zimbabwe and , like Cricket South Africa , finds this untenable, ' the ECB said in a statement .
' Therefore all bilateral arrangements are suspended with Zimbabwe Cricket with immediate effect .. .

' ( We ) welcome the government 's decision and share the government 's concerns about the deteriorating situation and lack of human rights in Zimbabwe. '

Zimbabwe 's eligibility to compete in next June 's Twenty20 tournament will be determined next Wednesday when the 13 directors on the ICC executive board meet in Dubai .

The British government hopes its emphatic policy will encourage a unified response from the cricket world , while stimulating more vigorous pressure from nonsporting bodies against the 'despotic regime. '

Brown 's tough stance contrasts with his predecessor Tony Blair 's position ahead of Zimbabwe 's last tour of England in 2003 , when a lack of direct intervention meant the trip went ahead because of the ECB 's fears about a hefty financial punishment .

' We want to ensure that Zimbabwe does not tour England next year, ' Brown told parliament .
' We will call for other countries to join us in banning Zimbabwe from the Twenty20 tournament. '

Brown 's Culture Secretary Andy Burnham said the close ties between the Zimbabwe cricket team to the Mugabe regime justify 'exceptional measures. '

He wrote to the ECB on Wednesday to outline how heightening concerns about the stricken nation had forced the British government to adopt a policy of isolation .
' The Zimbabwean government has ceased to observe the principle of the rule of law : it has terrorized its own citizens , including the ruthless and violent suppression of legitimate political opposition, ' Burnham wrote .

He added that Britain 'seeks to isolate Zimbabwe internationally and bring pressure to bear on supranational institutions such as the United Nations and European Union to take yet firmer action against the despotic regime. '

The ECB said it is now identifying a country to take Zimbabwe 's place for two tests and three one-day matches early next summer .
