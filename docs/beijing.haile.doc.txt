Gebrselassie will skip Beijing marathon - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- World record holder Haile Gebrselassie has again ruled out competing in the marathon at the Beijing Olympics , telling a Spanish newspaper that he would be 'committing suicide ' by running in unfavorable conditions .

Gebrselassie , who suffers from asthma , told El Pais that he would instead try to qualify for the Ethiopian team in the shorter 10,000 meters track event .
He was Olympic champion over the distance in Atlanta and Sydney .

His decision comes a day after the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) announced that it would consider postponing events at the Games such as the marathon if they felt conditions were unsafe .

' I have no intention of committing suicide in Beijing, ' Gebrselassie was quoted .

' I know that several other athletes are starting to have doubts about this .

' It 's purely a personal decision that I have taken to protect my health .
I do not want to endanger my future .
I do not want to kill myself in Beijing .

' The marathon will be impossible because of the pollution , heat and humidity. '

Gebrselassie added that he would attempt to finish his career with victory in the marathon at the London Olympics in 2012 when he would be 39 .

Concerns about pollution led the IOC medical commission to hire independent experts to conduct a study into air quality .

They concuded that heat and humidity would pose just as big a threat to long distance athletes .

' We find that the competitions , although not necessarily under ideal conditions at every moment ... will be good for athletes to compete during the Beijing Games. '

However , the IOC 's commission conceded there will be some risk to competitors in endurance events 'that include minimum one hour continuous physical efforts at high level - urban road cycling , mountain bike , marathon , marathon swimming , triathlon and road walk. '

And the risk is deemed high enough for the IOC to begin working on 'procedures which will allow a 'plan B ' to be activated for such events if necessary. '

The 34-year-old Gebrselassie holds the world marathon record of two hours four minutes and 26 seconds .
