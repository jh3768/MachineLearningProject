Britain's Brown: Al Qaeda fight a 'generation-long battle' - CNN.com
CAMP DAVID , Maryland ( CNN ) -- British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said Monday that the United States and Britain are engaged in a 'generation-long battle ' against al Qaeda-inspired terrorism and that Britain 'absolutely ' shares President Bush 's philosophy on the war on terror .

' This is a battle for which we can give no quarter .
It 's a battle that 's got to be fought in military , diplomatic , intelligence , security , policing and ideological terms, ' Brown said during a news conference .
' There should be no safe haven and no hiding place for those that practice terrorist violence or preach terrorist extremism. '

But on his maiden voyage to the White House , Brown kept his comments short regarding Iraq , focusing primarily on moving from combat to 'overwatch ' missions in three of the four provinces for which Britain has responsibility .

As expected , Brown emphasized that the U.S.-British alliance remains strong , but he also said he was disappointed with some aspects of the effort in Iraq -- namely difficulties 'getting political reconciliation within Iraq itself , moving forward the reconstruction and the time it has taken to do so. '

He said , however , he was pleased to see 'Iraq now building up its own security forces, ' which he estimated number about 300,000 .

Though he avoided discussing his administration 's purportedly waning support for Bush 's Iraq policy , he did express at least some solidarity with the United States .

' Our aim , as is the aim of the United States government , is threefold : security for the Iraqi people , political reconciliation and that the Iraqis have a stake in the future, ' Brown said .

The British and U.S. leaders met Sunday and Monday to discuss a host of topics in addition to Iraq .
Included were climate change , HIV and malaria , global poverty , international trade , the war on terror , the Middle East peace process and Afghanistan , according to Brown and Bush .

The leaders also discussed a way to end the genocide in Darfur , a situation Brown called 'the greatest humanitarian disaster the world faces today. '

Brown , who took the British helm last month after his predecessor Tony Blair -- a staunch proponent of Bush 's Iraq policy -- stepped down , has said that the United States remains Britain 's top ally .

' The American relationship for Britain is our strongest bilateral relationship and I am determined to do everything in my power to make sure that it is strong and effective in the work that it does, ' he said in a news conference before leaving for the United States .

However , Brown also has expressed a desire to distance himself from the White House policy on Iraq that disintegrated Blair 's popularity , and he has made moves in his Cabinet suggesting that he is considering alternative directions for the war-ravaged nation .

Brown appointed as foreign affairs minister a former U.N. official , Mark Malloch Brown , a critic of the United States who has warned that the United States and Britain will no longer be 'joined at the hip ' on foreign policy matters .
Also , Gordon Brown gave the international development minister post to Douglas Alexander , who recently called for more multilateralism during a visit to the United States .

Though Brown wrote Monday in an op-ed piece for The Washington Post that he came to the United States to affirm the two countries ' 'historic partnership, ' some in the White House are concerned that the new prime minister could change the course of Britain 's involvement in Iraq .

When Brown took power last month , Britain was amid a steady troop withdrawal from Iraq .
There have been reports that Brown could hasten the withdrawal , but the British prime minister has said he plans to keep promises made to the United Nations and Iraq .

Some in the United States are hoping that Brown can convince Bush to start pulling back U.S. troops .

' Frankly , I think our combat mission in Iraq should be ending .
So if Gordon Brown can persuade George Bush to change our role in Iraq , that would be , I think , a great assist from the British government, ' Rep. Jane Harman , D-California , said Sunday .

Though his commitment to standing alongside the United States on Iraq policy may be in question , Brown wrote in the Monday op-ed piece that his country 's commitment to fighting terrorism is not .

' It is our shared task to expose terrorism for what it is -- not a cause but a crime .
A crime against humanity, ' Brown wrote in The Post .

Brown also wrote that his commitment to combating the genocide in Darfur is unwavering .

' Our shared outrage at injustice means we can not stand by and watch the humanitarian crisis in Darfur without taking action to speed up the deployment of U.N.-African Union troops , call for an immediate cease-fire and , following America 's lead , impose sanctions if necessary, ' Brown wrote .

Speaking to reporters Monday , Brown expanded on his remarks , saying , 'I 've agreed with the president that we step up our pressure to end the violence that has displaced 2 million people , made 4 million hungry and reliant on food aid , and murdered 200,000 people. '
