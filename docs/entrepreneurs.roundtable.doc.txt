Entrepreneurs: An MME roundtable - CNN.com
LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- Dramatic economic expansion in the Middle East has forced the region to shop around for talent .

Expatriate workers have been moving there in numbers , tempted by the promise of healthy pay packets and exciting opportunities .

But now , the region 's starting to look closer to home as it consolidates its wealth .

This week , MME speaks with two leading business figures in the region : Esam Janahi , Chairman of Bahrain 's leading Islamic investment bank , Gulf Finance House , and Ferit Sahenk , Chairman of Turkish conglomerate , the Dogus Group .

John Defterios ( JD ) sat down with both business leaders and started with this question :

( JD ) : Bill Gates has said something that is quite interesting , that the Middle East needs to foster a culture of risk-taking and innovation using technology to advance intellectual capital in the future .
How are we progressing in the region on this front ?

Esam Janahi ( EJ ) : All in all , yes in terms of real intellectual assets in the region everyone is trying to pick that up and be attached with that model .

( JD ) : Ferit , do you think this current generation , your generation , our generation , is going to lead into a long sustainable economic model , that is not just based on commodities ?

Ferit Sahenk ( FS ) : Well , when I look at the new generation , what I like the most , apart from what we have been talking about , is the interaction among people , the collaboration creating these synergies .
Seventy-five percent of the growth is now coming from the mid-sized Turkish companies .
These are all family businesses , many of them second-generation .
It just shows that when there is an economic platform that is created by the government , people have more energy to take risks ; people have more willingness to take risks .
I think this is part of our people , our generation as well ; we are still hungry for success .

( JD ) : There is pressure throughout the Middle East right now to create jobs .
Do you feel comfortable with 80 million more workers coming into the workforce in the next ten years that this will be a success ?

( EJ ) : I think there are a lot of reforms happening within the region , a lot of forums to help Arab young leaders , just to push and address those unemployment figures for the GCC market .
The two biggest things between 2007 and 2012 was how can we create the private sector to become an accelerator for economic development projects .
This is where you can bring up the level of entrepreneurialship and innovation can take place while you are little bit in short labor .

( JD ) : Are you a believer , Ferit , from Turkey through to China , with South Asia included that this belt of growth is going to be the driver for the global economy , almost the rescuer of the global economy ?

( FS ) : Of course when things happen , like the subprime mortgage problem in the U.S. , that 's originated from a market like the United States , it affects us very much .
But what we are seeing is the developing world is going to be the engine of the world , definitely .
We are living in a globalized world .
I am expecting not only India and China but the whole growing world will affect the growth of the economies .

( JD ) : These sovereign wealth funds could actually help in a liquidity crisis or a slowdown .
Ferit , in your view , can you have it both ways ?
Can you have transparency and a code of conduct and still have the capital ?

( FS ) : You know , I personally believe in globalization very much .
To debate globalization is too late , it 's already there .
Sovereign funds , as long as they are treated as any other investors , and they do their investment with the psychology , with the evaluation techniques , just the way any other investor does , I think there should be no problem .
We should not be somehow afraid of a fund because it carries the brand name , or the brand , or the country .

( JD ) : Are you concerned -- you see front page articles both in the Business Week and the Economist about sovereign wealth funds -- that the competition amongst investors in the Gulf for trophy properties is getting a little bit ahead of itself ?
It 's not on valuation only , but to capture so of the best global brands in the world ?

( EJ ) : At the end of the day they are going to invest .
Investors are so sophisticated today it 's not anymore the normal technical sentiment that you want to get from the market .
People work out their way through fundamental analysis .

( JD ) : Ferit , what are your thoughts ?

( FS ) : These people are as sophisticated as the ones in the West .
Many of them are Harvard-educated , Oxford-educated .
Here they are British English , American English .
They have the same laptops , they have the same thinking , their passports are different .
There should not be any prejudice about investors .
We are in a globalized world , capital does n't have flag , capital does n't have color , it does n't have anything , so we should be open to it .
I hope they do make the right investments .
