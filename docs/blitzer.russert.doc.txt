Russert's passion showed in religion, family, work, sports - CNN.com
It was back in April when Pope Benedict XVI came to Washington .
The Rev .
David O'Connell , the president of The Catholic University of America , was hosting the pope for a large meeting with bishops .

Before that meeting , the Vatican said O'Connell could invite 10 guests to a small session with Benedict .
Tim Russert and I were the only journalists on that special guest list .
We were both thrilled , but Tim , a devout Catholic with deep roots in the Church , was very excited .

While we were waiting for the pope to arrive , he was like a little boy .
He had his rosaries in his hand , ready for the pope to bless them .
This was not the Tim Russert whom we all saw and admired as he grilled presidents , prime ministers , kings and mere politicians .
When the pope finally approached him , he could barely utter a word .
This was a special moment , and he knew it .

For those of us who knew him for a long time , we certainly could appreciate what he was enjoying .
His roots in Buffalo , New York , were deep and very humble .
His dad , 'Big Russ, ' was a sanitation worker who had often worked two shifts to make ends meet .
Russert knew where he was coming from , and as a result never complained about his own hard work for NBC News .

The same passion that he brought to covering politics and to his religious faith , he also brought to sports .
He loved the Washington Wizards and the Washington Nationals , but he really loved the Buffalo Bills .
How often would he end 'Meet the Press ' with the words 'Go Bills .
' All of us Bills fans had to endure four straight Super Bowl losses in the early 1990s , but few suffered as deeply as Tim .
We often spoke about those days .
I think he remembered every play of every game .

He was a unique talent and a wonderful man .
I feel especially sad that he died during this Father 's Day weekend .
It was such a special time for him , given his close relationship with Luke , his son , who just graduated from Boston College , and with 'Big Russ .
