A more conciliatory Farrakhan: 'I've evolved'  - CNN.com
CHICAGO , Illinois ( CNN ) -- When I sat down with Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan , I was surprised by what I found : a softer , more conciliatory Farrakhan -- a man who says his battle with cancer has changed him in ways he 'd never imagined .

He says he now wants to work together with all people and all religions to bring about peace in the world .

When I asked him what happened to the old Louis Farrakhan , he responded , 'I was a warrior then , defending myself against people who called me a black Hitler .
Now is a different climate .
I 've evolved. '

It was quite the revelation for a man whose fiery rhetoric often stirred anger .
He has been accused of anti-Semitism for his comments about Jews over the years , such as referring to 'wicked Jews ' in one speech .

But he 's also well-respected in the African-American community .
He helped organize the Million Man March in 1995 , and BET.com users selected him in 2005 as their 'Person of the Year .

Just last month , in what could be one of his final public appearances , Farrakhan announced to members of the Nation of Islam he would be stepping down for health reasons .

' I was trying to set things in place inside the Nation in case I passed away, ' he told me .

I have to say not many people intimidate me or make me nervous .
However , Farrakhan is one who does .
At least that 's what I thought going into the interview .

I came to CNN from Chicago , Farrakhan 's hometown , and had covered him for years as a local news reporter .
But I had never sat down with him one-on-one , let alone in his home in his living room .

It was a snowy Chicago morning when we arrived at his home in historic Hyde Park .
A few hours after setting up our equipment , Farrakhan walked downstairs .
But before his entourage announced him , I already knew he was there .

You could feel it in the room .

He looked good ; like himself .
But I could tell he was a little frail , a little wobbly .
And although he put on a good face , his handshake confirmed his frailness .

When he sat down , he immediately put me at ease .
He told me I could ask him anything .
So I put away my note pad with all the questions I wanted to ask and said , 'How are you doing ?
' We had an extremely open conversation that lasted for nearly two hours .
He touched on everything from his health to Barack Obama .

' I think he 's capable of being an answer, ' he said of the senator from Illinois .

He also talked about his battle with prostate cancer over the last several years .
He 'd tried to fight it holistically , and had had irradiated seeds implanted into his body to kill the cancer .
But the seeds had burned holes into some of his vital body parts .

He recounted the horrific day he almost bled to death in his bathroom , losing four units of blood in his home and then in the ambulance en route to the emergency room .
There , he says , doctors told him that if he did n't have traditional surgery to remove the cancer and repair the damage from the irradiated seeds , that he would 'surely die. '

He had the operation and survived .
And , at 73 , he 's still going .
But he also says when you reach his age , you 're always 'concerned about your mortality. '
