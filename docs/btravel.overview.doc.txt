As business travel increases, so do costs and headaches - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- Dave Malone is a traveling man .
He makes at least 40 trips a year for business , and has done so for some 30 years .

As the lead singer and guitarist for The Radiators , a New Orleans , Louisiana-based band that is known for its live shows , Malone may not seem like the typical business traveler .
But he has the typical business traveler 's complaints .

' Flights are oversold and more expensive , hotels are more expensive , rental cars are more expensive ; everything 's more expensive, ' Malone says .

It is not just the costs that are increasing , but also the inconvenience : Just recently , yet another delayed flight forced him and his four band mates to cancel a concert in Connecticut .
It is enough to make anybody sing the blues ( or at least a mix of blues , rock , soul and funk ) , but Malone can not recall any songs the band has composed specifically about business trips .
' We 've written songs having to do with other miseries, ' he says , 'but not with traveling. '

Mike Streit , who is also widely traveled ( 'I 'm somewhere every week ' ) , takes a more global view of business traveling , which makes sense , because his title is global leader of Advisory Services for American Express Business Travel .

Yes , business travel costs are on the rise , Streit says .
A recent report by his department forecast the average domestic business trip as costing more than $ 1,054 this year , an increase of about $ 46 from 2006 .
( The average international business trip is almost four times as much , and is expected to increase by $ 180 .

But business travel itself is on the rise as well , Streit says .
This , he says , reflects a new world of challenges ... and possibilities .

' One of the wonderful things happening in our globalized economy is that opportunities to connect with people are expanding, ' he says .
' We 're e-mailing more , we 're videoconferencing more -- and we 're traveling more .

' Travel can be viewed as an expense, ' Streit says , 'but it also can be viewed as an investment. '

More American-based companies are becoming multinational , many routinely dealing with dozens of countries around the world .
The economies of the Pacific Rim and of Latin America are creating new business growth , which offers the potential of new competition and new clients .

That is why business travel is increasing .
Business Travel News magazine estimates that some 300,000 companies in the United States have 'significant business travel expenses. '

Deloitte is a professional services firm that spends more than $ 200 million a year on plane tickets for its employees and is in the Top 10 in spending on travel .
The number of trips those employees take annually has gone up about 20 percent over the last couple of years , according to Michele Bryant , who manages the corporation 's employee travel .

At the same time , though , the travel industry has been struggling to keep up with the growing demand for its services .

The result ?

' The business traveler is seeing fuller planes , more delays , more of their baggage being mishandled, ' says David Meyer , editor-in-chief of Business Travel News .
' And they are having more trouble finding hotel rooms. '

A survey of business travelers by Accenture , a management consulting firm , last summer found that more than half had experienced 'maintenance-related travel delays or cancellations ' within the previous six months .

Several recent epic delays provoked Kate Hanni to found an organization to push for an 'Airline Passengers ' Bill of Rights, ' which has been introduced as a bill in Congress .
If passed into law , it would require , for example , that airlines be more forthcoming in information about delays and cancellations , and that , in the event of a long delay , passengers be provided with food and water and other essentials .

' The travel industry recognizes that there has been some hardship for individual business travelers , and is trying to figure out how to improve its services, ' says Paul Chiu , head of the division of Accenture that advises travel and hospitality-related companies .

Much of the activity seems to be focused on amenities .
American Airlines , for example , is spending $ 1.3 million on each of 15 airplanes to replace the seats in first class and business class and provide on-demand video .

The increased demand for travel , without a sufficient rise in supply , helps explain the boost in cost for all three major categories of business travel -- airline flights , hotel rooms and car rentals .

Other factors include the rising price of fuel , which has increased the price of airline travel and rental cars , as well as the cost of car services ; the financial difficulties facing the automobile industry , which also have had an impact on car rental costs ; and a lag in construction of new hotel rooms to meet the rising demand .

' Because hotels are overrun with people, ' Chiu says , 'it 's just inevitable that you 're going to get increased levels of dissatisfaction. '

Corporate travel managers , as well as individual business travelers , have been taking steps to keep down both costs and dissatisfaction .

Both try to make reservations as far in advance as possible , to assure the availability of a hotel room , and to bring down the cost of a flight .

More than three quarters of the corporate travel managers in several surveys are using online booking tools -- as are many individual business travelers .

A survey conducted by the National Business Travel Association , a trade group that represents about 1,700 of the travel managers in the biggest corporations , showed that many of its members are planning to negotiate longer and larger contracts with hotel chains and airlines ; this would leverage their volume to bring down cost .

Travel managers expect to be using more midtier hotels , instead of luxury hotels .
And they also are taking steps to make sure their employees actually stay in the hotels , and book the flights on the airlines , with which the companies have made their deals .
Some companies are even asking their traveling employees to double up in hotel rooms .

' The allure of business travel , ' Chiu sums up , 'is not what it 's cracked up to be. '
