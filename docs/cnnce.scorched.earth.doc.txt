Next , group students and have each group select an environmental issue from the list .
Direct each group to online and library resources to learn about the scope of its environmental problem , the issue 's underlying causes and the measures that are being taken to address the situation .
After the group completes its research , members should identify the best approach for solving the environmental problem .
As the group formulates its plan , instruct students to consider the roles that each of the following parties should play in executing the solution :

federal , state and local governments , corporations , small businesses , community groups , environmental groups , non-profit organizations , schools , local citizens .

Direct groups to prepare multimedia presentations of their findings and their proposed solutions .
Following each presentation , facilitate a class discussion about the potential benefits and drawbacks of the proposal .
