Should your boss be your Facebook friend? - CNN.com
Facebook 's been around for almost five years -- a lifetime in the Internet world -- and by now it has become a mainstay of workers who want to kill a little ( or a lot ) of time updating their statuses and playing Scrabble .

Hidden deep beneath the site 's fun , technological distractions , some people are actually using the site for its intended purpose : networking ( social and professional ) .

You know , touching base and building relationships with people -- all things that used to be done in person with awkward phone calls and cocktail-party pleasantries .

At workplaces , online networking has become an effective way for co-workers within the same building or on different continents to connect .
Bosses and employees are also friending each other , which can make balancing personality and professionalism difficult .

There are obvious drawbacks to letting the boss see too much of your non-work self , but do the positives compensate ?

Before you decide if you should be your superior 's Facebook friend , you have to ask yourself why you would want to be online buddies .
Is everyone else in your department connected online or are you going to be the only employee SuperPoking the boss ?

' If you work for a forward-thinking company whose entire staff is on Facebook , then your participation is the online equivalent of lunching with co-workers or a water cooler chat, ' says Patrice-Anne Rutledge , a social networking expert and author of 'The Truth About Profiting from Social Networking. '

' The advantage to connecting with a current or former boss on Facebook is the opportunity for more personalized networking .
When you connect online , you get to know someone better, ' Rutledge says .

' You could discover a common interest in marathon running , foreign films or yoga , for example , that could help your boss get to know you better as a person .
These personal connections can become a major asset when you 're looking to move forward in your career or find a new job. '

Of course , networking with colleagues is different than friending the boss .

Do you or do n't you ?

Naturally , you do n't necessarily want to be your boss 's virtual pal if you have something to hide .
The obvious drawback to online friendship is that your profile is open to your list of friends , and that means the good and the bad of your online persona is fair game .

' If you use Facebook to air political rants , document your wild weekend escapades , post wacky photos or vent about your job , you should obviously have some concerns about letting your boss view this aspect of your life, ' Rutledge cautions .
' But what 's important to remember is that no online content is truly private , even if your intention is to share this information only with your Facebook friends .
Facebook makes your profile viewable to anyone in the networks you belong to , even if you 're not directly connected with or even know all the network members, ' Rutledge says .

You should be monitoring your online content as though your current and future boss can see it , even if they are n't on your buddy list .

' Unprofessional online content , or 'digital dirt ' as it 's often called , is a problem that goes beyond Facebook .
Anything you post online is essentially public and can affect your career and job prospects , both positively and negatively. '

The rules of engagement

Like the beginning of any relationship , online networking requires that someone make the first move .
As you might expect , you need to be the judge based on your experience at the company .

' In some cutting-edge companies , entire work groups -- from VPs to interns -- are on Facebook and interact regularly .
In other circumstances , the proper etiquette would be to wait for an invitation or bring up the subject during a private discussion to see if your boss is open to the idea, ' Rutledge says .
You do n't want to put your boss in an awkward position or come across as presumptuous .

' In other companies , younger workers may be hard-pressed to find any members of senior management on Facebook, ' she explains .
' The bottom line is that you really need to understand the 'unwritten rules ' in your corporate culture to determine the appropriate way to initiate a Facebook connection. '

But if you have some unsavory online content attached to your profile , what do you do if your boss made the first move ?

' Declining this invitation obviously is n't a very smart idea , but you can remove your digital dirt before accepting the connection .
' Rutledge suggests that , if your profile is viewable to the entire company or city network , the boss may have already seen it , so a speedy clean-up is in your best interest .

For the sake of your professionalism , here are some important factors to keep in mind when logging into Facebook or similar sites :

& # 8226 ; Networks .
The default setting on many sites allows a profile to be viewable to people in your networks , which can be defined by broad categories like your city or alma mater .
You have to actively restrict who can see your information .
In your settings options , you can opt to be someone 's friend but not let them see your pictures or what comments people leave on your Wall .
This way you can still be yourself and maintain a good professional relationship with your boss .

& # 8226 ; Audience .
If your profile can be seen by people who are n't friends , keep in mind that your views are n't necessarily shared by everyone .
So your current boss might agree with your diatribe against a Supreme Court ruling , but a future employer might not .

& # 8226 ; The Wall .
The Wall , which is the place where friends can post comments or videos to your profile , is viewable to all of your friends and networks ( unless you restrict access to it ) .
Even if you 're on your best behavior , you should make sure your friends are , too .
Otherwise , hilarious but inappropriate accounts of your wilder days can creep into your profile .
