Bush outlines goals to fight climate change - CNN.com
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Bush on Wednesday called for halting the growth of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 2025 and said Congress -- not judges or regulators -- should take the lead role in grappling with global warming .

Bush , who leaves office in nine months , offered no specific proposals in the address .

But he laid out a framework for future measures he said would balance the need to curb carbon emissions blamed for increasing global temperatures , with protecting the U.S. economy .

The steps were immediately dismissed as 'grossly insufficient ' by the Sierra Club , while a leading Democratic congressman called the speech 'too little , too late. '

Bush said his administration 's support of increased fuel-economy standards and alternative fuel research is 'a solid foundation for further progress. '

The next step , he said , would be to halt the growth of power industry emissions within 10 to 15 years -- steps he said depend on encouraging new technologies .

' The strategy I have laid out today shows faith in the ingenuity and enterprise of the American people -- and that 's a resource that will never run out, ' he said .

Congress this year is slated to consider several competing bills aimed at reducing the carbon emissions blamed for an increase in global temperatures .
Bush urged lawmakers to offer incentives to develop new technologies and to avoid tax increases , new mandates or demands for sudden emissions cuts .

' The wrong way is to unilaterally impose regulatory costs that put American businesses at a disadvantage with their competitors abroad , which would simply drive American jobs overseas and increase emissions there, ' he said .

' The right way is to ensure that all major economies are bound to take action and to work cooperatively with our partners for a fair and effective international climate agreement. '

Bush , a onetime oil executive , was widely criticized for abandoning after he took office the 1997 Kyoto Protocol which aimed to limit greenhouse gas concentrations .

But he said his administration had reduced the 'intensity ' of carbon emissions -- a ratio of emissions to economic growth , which his administration adopted as its preferred standard .

Bush said Congress should make sure current U.S. environmental laws do n't get 'stretched ' by courts or federal agencies to cover emissions from smaller sources like schools , hospitals and small businesses .

' Decisions with such far-reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges, ' he said .
' Such decisions should be debated openly and made by the elected representatives of the people they affect .
The American people deserve an honest assessment of the costs , benefits and feasibility of any proposed solution. '

Ahead of Bush 's announcement , Rep. Rahm Emanuel , D-Illinois , said Bush 's proposals were 'too little , too late. '

' Now , after seven years of denying that global warming is a problem , the president will offer a tepid announcement that only ensures that the climate crisis will continue, ' said Emanuel , the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus .

The Sierra Club , one of the largest environmental advocacy organizations , said emissions need to be rolled back , not just restrained , to prevent the worst effects of an increase in global temperatures .

' The president is throwing a Hail Mary to polluters in a last-ditch effort to stave off any meaningful action on global warming, ' the group 's executive director , Carl Pope , said in a written statement Wednesday .
' Under the president 's plan , we 'll need a real miracle to save us from global warming. '

But James Connaughton , the chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality , told reporters the United States faces a 'regulatory train wreck ' under current laws .

' Let 's say , for example , a school was trying to change a couple classrooms, ' he said .

If the courts or the Environmental Protection Agency decide that carbon dioxide emissions have to be restricted , 'This might trigger them having to completely redo their heating and ventilation system for the entire school .
Well , maybe they do n't have the money for that .
That 's the kind of effect that 's going to come from this. '

Both Democratic presidential candidates and Sen. John McCain , the presumptive Republican nominee , support capping carbon emissions .
But Connaughton said the administration still opposes any effort to cap overall emissions -- a step he said would be 'disastrous ' economically .

' Too much of our focus often is on it 's only the government that 's going to solve this, ' he said .
' We have to empower the private sector to do so , as well. '
