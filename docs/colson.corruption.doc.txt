Commentary: I know what Illinois governor feels like now - CNN.com
Editor 's note : Charles W. Colson , a former aide to President Nixon , is the founder of Prison Fellowship , the world 's largest Christian outreach to prisoners .
President Bush this week acknowledged Colson 's work among prisoners , awarding him the Presidential Citizens Medal .
Colson was imprisoned for obstruction of justice in the attempt to smear Daniel Ellsberg , who disclosed the secret history of the Vietnam War known as the Pentagon Papers .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- If anyone knows how Illinois Gov .
Rod Blagojevich feels right now , I do .

On Tuesday , the governor was arrested in a glare of publicity and charged with going on 'a corruption crime spree, ' as U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald described it -- including alleged attempts to sell President-elect Barack Obama 's Senate seat .

Some 35 years ago that ugly glare of publicity was focused on me as I was charged with a Watergate-related crime , subsequently convicted and sent to prison .
The governor has n't been convicted and is entitled to the presumption of innocence .

In the wake of Blagojevich 's arrest , many Americans are left wondering once again how intelligent people can do such stupid things -- especially when they 've achieved the pinnacle of power .

The answer comes down to pride .

At the height of Watergate , a dear friend of mine , Tom Phillips , then CEO of Raytheon , invited me to his home .
As we sat in his kitchen , Tom read to me a chapter on pride from a little book by C.S .
Lewis titled 'Mere Christianity. '

Lewis wrote , 'There is one vice of which no man in the world is free .
... The vice I am talking about is Pride or Self-conceit .
.... Pride leads to every other vice .
... A proud man is always looking down on things and people : and , of course , as long as you are looking down , you can not see something that is above you .
... Pride is a spiritual cancer : it eats up the very possibility of love , or contentment , or even common sense. '

Tom -- who told me about Jesus Christ that night -- did n't know I was in utter despair over Watergate , watching the president I 'd worked for flounder in office .
I 'd learned I might become a target of the investigation .
In short , my world was collapsing .

That night I sat in a darkened driveway and in a flood of tears called out to God .
I did n't know what to say ; I just knew I needed Christ .
At that moment God took the White House 'hatchet man ' and turned me into a new creation .

I went on to serve seven months in prison .
As lonely and demeaning as that experience was , I have never regretted it .
I can honestly agree with Alexander Solzhenitsyn , who wrote from the gulag , 'Bless you , prison , bless you for being in my life , for there , lying on the rotting prison straw , I came to realize that the object of life is not prosperity , as we are made to believe , but the maturing of the human soul. '

Which brings me to a second reason for Blagojevich 's fall : the culture of self .

Like me , Blagojevich grew up in a culture that taught the great goal of life was material success , power and influence .
I grew up during the Great Depression ; I thought if a smart guy like me earned a law degree and accumulated academic honors , they would enable me to find power , fulfillment and meaning in life .

I made a lot of money in my law practice and accepted a White House job .
But by then , I had became very self-righteous ; I was absolutely certain that no one could corrupt me .
All my investments went into a blind trust .
Whenever someone gave me a gift , I immediately turned it over to my chauffeur .
And yet I ended up going to prison .

I now realize that every human being has an infinite capacity for self-rationalization and self-delusion .
Those who serve in public life are faced with enormous peer pressure and do n't always take time to stop and think carefully about what they 're doing .

Sometimes -- absorbed in accumulating political power -- they 're not interested in stopping to think .
But as I learned firsthand , self-obsession destroys character .
It has to .

Tragically , America is continuing to rear its young to become not only self-obsessed , but obsessed with personal power .
Quaint-sounding virtues such as courage , honesty and prudence -- historically considered the elements of character -- are no match for a society in which the exaltation and gratification of self becomes the overriding goal of life .

If Blagojevich is guilty , the best thing that could happen to him is to be tried and convicted .
He 's going to have to reach rock bottom -- just as I did -- before he will be able to escape his own prison of pride , self-delusion and self-righteousness .
But that 's a transformation we can never accomplish on our own .
I can vouch for the fact that human pride is simply too strong .

Lewis was right : Pride is a spiritual cancer .
And the only cure , for any of us , is to stop looking down and to look up .
The cure can only be brought about in someone who has come to realize that the will and power to do good and not evil comes from God alone .
