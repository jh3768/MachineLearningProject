Court tosses 'wardrobe malfunction' fine - CNN.com
PHILADELPHIA , Pennsylvania ( AP ) -- A federal appeals court on Monday threw out a $ 550,000 indecency fine against CBS Corp. for the 2004 Super Bowl halftime show that ended with Janet Jackson 's breast-baring 'wardrobe malfunction. '

The three-judge panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Federal Communications Commission 'acted arbitrarily and capriciously ' in issuing the fine for the fleeting image of nudity .

The 90 million people watching the Super Bowl , many of them children , heard Justin Timberlake sing , 'Gon na have you naked by the end of this song, ' as he reached for Jackson 's bustier .

The court found that the FCC deviated from its nearly 30-year practice of fining indecent broadcast programming only when it was so 'pervasive as to amount to 'shock treatment ' for the audience. '

' Like any agency , the FCC may change its policies without judicial second-guessing, ' the court said .
' But it can not change a well-established course of action without supplying notice of and a reasoned explanation for its policy departure. '
