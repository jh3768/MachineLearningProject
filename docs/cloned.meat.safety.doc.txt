Is cloned meat safe? - CNN.com
Soon , the food you put on your dinner table may be from cloned animals and chances are , you wo n't even know it .
The Food and Drug Administration announced in January 2008 that 's it OK to sell meat and milk from cloned cattle , pigs and goats .
What does this mean to the consumer ?
Is cloned meat safe ?
How does it differ from regular animal products ?

Questions and answers Why is it going to be difficult to tell if you 're buying cloned products ?
Dr. Sanjay Gupta , CNN chief medical correspondent : Because they wo n't be labeled .
Meat from cloned animals looks just like meat from traditionally bred animals .
If it 's prepared the same way and sold without labels , the average consumer will have no idea he or she is eating cloned meat .
Even though the FDA has deemed cloned foods safe , a lot of people still question the ethics of cloning animals as well as the safety issue .
When the FDA held focus groups , one-third of those asked said they wanted nothing to do with cloned products .
Without FDA labels , it 's going to be nearly impossible to tell whether you are buying cloned products .
Why are n't they requiring the products to be labeled ?
And what can consumers do if they do n't want cloned food ?
Gupta : FDA and officials from the USDA said in January that it was not up to them to require labeling -- it was only for them to decide , scientifically , if cloned food was safe .
They have based their decisions on data from a National Academy of Sciences study done in 2002 , as well as from a peer-reviewed group of independent scientific experts on cloning that found the FDA 's methods to evaluate the data were adequate .
The FDA said that since it found cloned products to be safe , there is no reason to label them differently .
Agency officials said if companies with products from non-cloned animals want to label them as such , they can .
But that gets expensive .
When asked what consumers should do if they are hesitant to buy meat and milk after cloned products enter the marketplace , the USDA said people can buy organic .
But organic food costs more money as well .
It may look the same , but does it taste any different ?
Gupta : The FDA has put a voluntary moratorium on the market , asking farmers who raise cloned animals not to sell cloned products .
So there is n't much cloned meat or milk out there right now .
Last year the Los Angeles Times got hold of some cloned beef and had a local chef cook it up into steaks and burgers and asked scientists and food experts to taste it .
We spoke to two of those tasters , Dr. Barry Glassner from the University of Southern California and Greg Jaffe of the Center for Science in the Public Interest , and both said there was very little difference .

Jaffe found the meat to be fine , a little tough , because it had been frozen .
But he said taste , texture and color were the same as regular meat .
Glassner liked the taste very much .
He said it tasted great , exactly like regular beef .
During the taste test , they did n't know which was which when they were tasting it .
When might cloned food be on the market ?
Gupta : These products will come from offspring of cloned animals , and there are about 600 cloned breeding animals in this country , so it will take time to breed them and get the food out to consumers .
Neither federal agency would commit to a timetable , but it will be a couple of years before cloned food appears on our grocery store shelves .
