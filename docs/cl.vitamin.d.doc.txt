Vitamin D is hot! Here's how to get it - CNN.com
Vitamin D is becoming an increasingly important player in a healthful diet .
Over the past 10 years , a spate of research has linked it to an impressive and diverse array of potential benefits .
In addition to vitamin D 's well-known function of increasing calcium absorption and thereby helping encourage healthy bone growth , it has shown promise in helping to prevent certain cancers , heart disease , diabetes , and osteoarthritis .

However , while many in the scientific community are excited about its promise , they have yet to agree on how much you need and where to obtain it .
Read on to better understand the debate and learn what 's best for you .

What vitamin D does

Vitamin D is unique in many ways .
At the time of its discovery in 1919 , vitamins A , B , and C were already identified ; D was the next letter in line , so that was the name given to the compound .
However , vitamin D behaves like a hormone in the body , relaying chemical messages -- something no other vitamin does .
For example , vitamin D signals the intestines to absorb calcium from foods and to regulate its uptake by bone cells .

Some nutrients , such as vitamin C , are put to work immediately by the body in the form in which they are consumed .
Vitamin D , however , requires processing .
Vitamin D begins as a relative of cholesterol .
Dehydrocholesterol molecules are stored in your skin , waiting to absorb sunlight .
When this occurs , dehydrocholesterol can be transformed into previtamin D3 ( cholecalciferol ) , the most readily absorbed form of vitamin D. Another form , previtamin D2 ( ergocalciferol ) is derived from plant sources and can only be obtained through diet .
Both previtamins are processed by the liver and kidneys into a final form called calcitriol , which then travels to the vitamin D receptors that exist in almost all , if not all , cells in your body .

' Vitamin D is a key component in helping the body respond to many different kinds of assaults and stimuli , ' says Robert Heaney , PhD. , professor of medicine at Creighton University in Omaha , Nebraska .
' In the absence of it , you 're asking the body to defend itself with one hand tied behind its back. '

Most of the good news about vitamin D comes thanks to improved methods of measuring the levels of vitamin D in the body .
' We did n't have a good way to measure vitamin D until 15 years ago , and the test took five to 10 years to reach widespread use, ' Heaney says .
' Previously , the only indicator of vitamin D deficiency was rickets [ a disease resulting in softened bones ] . '

How much do you need ?

The Institute of Medicine , a group that uses scientific research to formulate public health policies , currently recommends an Adequate Intake , or AI , rather than a specific daily amount of vitamin D. The AI for vitamin D is 200 International Units for adults under age 50 , 400 IU for those 51 to 70 , and 600 IU for those age 71 and above .
As new studies continue to showcase vitamin D 's potential benefits , more scientists are calling for increased recommendations .
Some suggest as much as 10,000 IU --currently the tolerable upper intake daily .

Late last year , a group of leading scientists published an editorial in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition calling for an 'urgent need ' to increase the AI for vitamin D. Among them was Walter Willett , M.D. , the widely respected chairperson of the Harvard School of Public Health 's department of nutrition .
' The range we are talking about -- 1,000 IU per day --is still a small dose, ' Willett says .
( Consider this : A fair-skinned person can manufacture 15,000 IU or more of vitamin D in as little as 30 minutes of optimal sun exposure .

In response to the debate , the National Institutes of Health 's Office of Dietary Supplements last year began an intensive effort to learn more about vitamin D , partnering with other federal agencies to assemble a panel to assess research needs and priorities .
Their efforts may result in a new AI when the Dietary Guidelines for Americans are revised in 2010 .

' Scientists agree that as the DRIs are revisited , vitamin D is one of the first recommendations that should be reconsidered, ' says Patsy M. Brannon , PhD. , professor of nutrition at Cornell University who coordinates the ODS ' vitamin D initiative .
' The current recommendation is a decade old .
There 's been a lot of research in the last 10 years .
Whether there is sufficient strength of evidence to increase recommendations is where scientists disagree. '

Until they reach a consensus , you have three options for obtaining vitamin D : food , sunlight , or supplements .

Source 1 : Food

Foods naturally rich in vitamin D are scarce .
Seafood options top the list -- cod liver oil , salmon , mackerel and tuna .
( Bonus : they also contain heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids .
) After that , fortified foods help fill the gap .
Milk is fortified with 100 IU per 8-ounce serving .
Some yogurts and cheeses also contain vitamin D , as do breakfast cereals and juices .

Source 2 : Sunlight

Every time sunlight warms our skin , your body produces vitamin D. However , sunlight is unreliable and several factors influence its ability to induce vitamin D production , including : the angle of the sun , the latitude in which you live , you skin pigmentation , age , and use of skin-care products containing sun-protection factor ( SPF ) .
Also , there 's the not-small matter of skin cancer risk , which is heightened by exposure to sunlight .

Source 3 : Supplements

Supplements are a reliable -- and safe -- source of vitamin D. The key is buying the right type of supplement .
Most multivitamins are fortified with the current AI for vitamin D ; 400 IU .
