The Boston Beer Company - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- The recipe for the Boston Beer Company 's Samuel Adams Boston Lager brand was stored in James Koch 's attic since the 1800s by his great-great grandfather .

The first batch of the lager brewed in recent years was made in Koch 's kitchen in 1984 .
This was the beginning of the Boston Beer Company .

Samuel Adams is the flagship lager for the company and is brewed using traditional brewing methods such as decoction mash , krausening and dry hopping .

The name Samuel Adams was chosen in honor of the Boston patriot , a revolutionary thinker who fought for American independence .
Samuel Adams was also a brewer who had inherited a brewing tradition from his father .

The first Samuel Adams lager went on sale April 1985 , and by the end of the year sales reached 500 barrels .

Over the course of 2006 the company sold approximately 1.6 million barrels of beer across the U.S .

Six weeks after its introduction , Samuel Adams was selected as 'The Best Beer in America ' in The Great American Beer Festival 's Consumer Preference Poll , an award it went on to win an unprecedented four times .

Since 2000 , Samuel Adams has won more awards in international beer tasting competitions than any other brewery in the world .
