Get your BlackBerry out of our bed! - CNN.com
( LifeWire ) -- Like other couples , D-D Flannery and her husband have an assortment of buzzing hand-held devices in the bedroom to help keep things lively .
The problem is , these devices do n't improve their love life -- just their work flow .

' If you come to my house in the evening , you 'll find me in bed with the laptop on my lap , the cordless land line next to me , and then my Treo, ' says Flannery , a 31-year-old public relations consultant from Rochester , New York .

She says the same goes for her husband , Aaron Lazenby , 35 , a mortgage consultant .

These days , laptops , cell phones and smart phones allow us to instantly connect with others while standing in line , working out and even cuddling on the couch .
Unfortunately , the ubiquitous nature of our digital technology also makes for some very strange bedfellows .

Really personal technology

According to a recent Solutions Research Group study of nearly 5,000 Americans , more than 63 percent of BlackBerry users take the device into the bathroom .
And 37 percent of laptop owners 'frequently ' use their computers in the bedroom .

' I 've been known to answer the phone from the shower, ' says Flannery , whose PR business includes crisis management work .
' And I call the bathroom my husband 's 'conference room .

Luckily , the pair is well-matched , digitally speaking , so taking care of business -- even in the bathroom -- is n't an issue : 'We both have a similar approach to business and customer service , so it works for us, ' she says .

But others have a more lopsided approach to laptop love , as Steven Porricelli , a 36-year-old high school teacher from Cranston , Rhode Island , can attest .

' Technology is a necessary evil, ' Porricelli says of his wife , Jane , who runs the family-oriented Web site pinksandblues.com .
' She 's always texting in one hand and Twittering ( an online social network and messaging service ) on the other .
I 've woken up before and she 'll be zonked out in bed with the laptop on her lap .
It 's insane .
Sometimes I just want to throw her stuff out the window. '

Keeping the Tech In Check

Instead , Porricelli tries to help his wife keep things in balance .

' I try to remind her that we need time , too, ' he says , 'that the laptop occasionally needs to be shut down and set aside .
My wife is an amazing person , but she 's a workaholic .
' ( He says he 'd never throw her laptop out the window , but he has hidden it under the couch cushions .

Erin Sekerak , a 29-year-old marketing maven from Pittsburgh , says her husband , Jason , also 29 , an auditor , has put the kibosh on her connectivity as well .

' One time we were driving to my parents ' house and I was doing stuff on my BlackBerry -- both work stuff and chatting with friends -- and he was like , 'I want to talk ; put that thing away,' ' she says .
' He actually took it away from me and put it in his pocket. '

Joe Guppy , a Seattle couples counselor , says today 's couples often find it challenging to keep the communication devices from getting in the way of , well , communicating .

' Communication problems seem to be the No .
1 thing people ask about when they call, ' he says .
' They come to the session and pay me $ 100 just so they can sit together and talk .
And to me , the No .
1 red flag is if each person is engaged in their own cyberworld or video world .
I had one couple that would even get into arguments via text message. '

Guppy recommends sharing digital distractions so one partner does n't feel left out ( Sekerak and her husband choose Netflix movies together ) and establishing limits .

' Over time , we 've learned to set boundaries, ' says Flannery , the PR consultant .
' We ca n't answer phone calls during dinner .
We ca n't bring the phone to church with us. '

Digital Sabbaticals

But setting boundaries is n't always easy .
With technology so affordable , commonplace and seemingly indispensable , its addictive potential is hard to deny .

' Certainly not everyone who uses technology has a problem .
But if you 're missing things in your life , you 're online for hours and people are complaining , you 're driving and texting at the same time , then you may need to set some limits , some rules, ' says John O'Neill , director of addictions services at the Menninger Clinic in Houston .
' We 're not asking people to get hospitalized or get treatment , but to cut back in order to be present in their relationships .
I think most people probably can do that. '

Ariel Meadows Stallings , 32 , an author , blogger and marketing manager from Seattle , recently started a project she calls 52 Nights Unplugged after realizing her dependence on technology had 'gotten a little creepy .
' Every Tuesday night , she shuts off the TV , computer and cell phone and takes a short digital sabbatical .

' When I first told my husband what I was going to do , he was dubious, ' says Stallings .
' He 's the one who brings me the laptop in bed .
But I 'm in my 10th week now and it 's going great .
I 'm doing a lot more reading and crafting and even taking a dance class. '

Stallings calls her project a 'raging success, ' although there are still occasional twinges of online envy .

' My husband 's not doing the unplugged thing ; he does n't feel he needs to, ' she says .
' So there are nights that I 'm unplugged and he 's checking his e-mail and surfing on his laptop , and I 'm like , 'Grrrrr .
