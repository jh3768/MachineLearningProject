Kaymer pulls six clear at BMW International - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- Rising German star Martin Kaymer goes into Sunday 's final round of the BMW International Open in Munich with a commanding six-shot lead as he eyes a second win on the European Tour this season .

Kaymer went into the third round with a five-shot advantage courtesy of his brilliant 63 on Friday and produced a flawless 67 to show his front running qualities at 18-under-par overall .

The 23-year-old from Dussedorf will move to sixth in the Ryder Cup points table with victory and has South African Charl Schwartzel as his closest challenger .

' My chances will be very good , that 's obvious, ' Kaymer said of making the team that plays the Americans in September .

' If not , I think I will have other chances .
I 'm just trying to enjoy this , especially in Germany, ' he told the Associated Press .

Joint third , one further back , are English trio Paul Casey , Ross Fisher and Benn Barham and Frenchman Thomas Levet .

' I feel like I 'm playing good -- I 'm currently at 11-under, ' Casey said .
' But if he ( Kaymer ) continues to play like that , there 's no way we 're going to catch him. '

Last year 's Rookie of the Year Kaymer had his overnight advantage cut to two by the time he teed off again in the glorious sunshine , but conjured up birdies on the sixth , eighth and ninth to impose his quality on the field .

A chip-and-putt birdie four on the long 11th widened the gap still further and rounded off a fine five-under-par round with a 25-foot birdie putt on the last .

Veteran Colin Montgomerie showed improved form as he reached eight under after 11 holes , but he dropped shots coming home for a 68 and trails by 11 shots .

Best round of the day was produced by England 's Iain Pyman with a eight-under-par 64 to go to nine-under overall .
