Bush: Congress standing between Americans and offshore oil - CNN.com
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Bush pressed lawmakers Tuesday to lift a ban on offshore oil drilling , saying 'the only thing standing between the American people and these vast oil resources is action from the U.S. Congress . '

On Monday , the president lifted an executive order that prohibited offshore drilling .
A 1981 law barring the practice remains in effect , however , and Congress would have to vote to repeal the law before any drilling could occur .
Congressional Democrats have opposed efforts to repeal the ban .

' The sooner Congress lifts the ban , the sooner we can get these resources from the ocean floor to the refineries , to the gas pump, ' the president said .

' Democratic leaders have been delaying action on offshore exploration , and now they have an opportunity to show that they finally heard the frustrations of the American people, ' Bush said .
' They should match the action I have taken , repeal the congressional ban and pass legislation to facilitate responsible offshore exploration. '

Congressional Republicans joined the president in pressing the Democrats to repeal the drilling ban .

House Minority Leader John Boehner , R-Ohio , accused congressional Democrats of standing 'in the way of more American-made energy ' and pushed for legislation that would not only permit offshore drilling but also allow oil exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska and the processing of oil-containing sand in the West .
Democrats have repeatedly blocked oil exploration in ANWR , arguing that it would damage the fragile Arctic environment .

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Kentucky , said ' $ 4-a-gallon gasoline is unacceptable to the American people and unacceptable to the Republicans in Congress , and we want to do something about it .
And doing something about it involves both finding more and using less .
We need to do both. '

But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D-California , resisted the Republicans ' calls for an expansion of offshore drilling , saying it would do little to reduce prices at the pump in the near term .

What the president should do immediately to lower gas prices , Pelosi said , is release oil from the 700 million barrels in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve .
Bush has resisted that move because , he says , it would hurt national security .

' The president said ... that drilling offshore would not have an impact on the price at the pump , and I 'm glad he 's finally admitted that to the American people, ' Pelosi said .
' Our message back to the president is , 'It 's the economy , Mr. President. ' '

Officials in coastal states , including Florida and California , have also expressed opposition to Bush 's push to expand offshore drilling .

California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , a Republican , issued a statement Monday afternoon that said , 'I know people are frustrated with the soaring price of gas , and I welcome the national debate on solutions to lower our energy costs , but in California , we know offshore drilling is not the answer .
We will continue to foster a market for alternative energies , because choice is the only way we will ultimately bring down fuel costs .

But Bush said Tuesday that lifting the ban would 'send a signal that we 're willing to explore for ... oil here at home. '

' I fully understand this is ... a transition period away from hydrocarbons, ' he said .
' But we ought to be wise about how we ... use our own resources. '

The potential damage drilling could cause to reefs has been a major reason driving opposition to an expansion of offshore drilling , but Bush said new technology would allow companies to explore for oil without damaging coastal reefs .

' I 'm concerned about the reefs .
I 'm a fisherman .
I like to fish .
Reefs are important for fisheries, ' Bush said .

' But the technology is such that you can protect the reefs, ' he said , noting that new techniques allow for companies to drill vertically far from a reef and then drill horizontally to get to oil reserves that are under sensitive reef environments .
