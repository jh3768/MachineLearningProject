Bale apologizes for 'Terminator' tantrum - CNN.com
LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) -- Christian Bale wants everyone to make fun of him for his profanity-filled tirade against a crew member on the set of 'Terminator : Salvation. '

' I deserve it completely, ' Bale told the hosts of a Los Angeles radio show Friday .

In a phone call to KROQ-FM 's 'Kevin and Bean ' show , Bale apologized for the rant last July against Shane Hurlbut , the movie 's director of photography , which was captured on a much-distributed audio recording .

' I was out of order beyond belief, ' Bale said .
' I was way out of order .
I acted like a punk .
I regret that. '

Bale said that although he has been able to laugh at the jokes , 'it 's been a miserable week for me. '

' There is nobody that has heard that tape that is hit harder by it than me, ' he said .
' I make no excuses for it .
It is inexcusable. '

Bale , who starred as Batman in last year 's 'The Dark Knight, ' takes on the role of John Connor in the upcoming 'Terminator ' sequel .

Bale 's four-minute rant began when he saw Hurlbut checking a light on the set in a hangar at New Mexico 's Kirtland Air Force Base .

' Do you understand my mind is not in the scene if you 're doing that ?
' Bale is heard saying , in one of the few sentences on the tape not involving profanity .

Bale told Hurlbut they were 'done professionally ' and that Bale would not continue filming unless Hurlbut was fired .

With his apology , Bale offered 'a little bit of context. '

He said he 'was trying to show a little of that 'in the blood ' craziness ' that put his character 's mother , Sarah Connor , in an insane asylum .

' And you know what ?
It went very wrong, ' Bale said .

' I got annoyed and then what happened , I made it ugly and that was awful of me, ' he said .
' I took it way too far and I completely mixed up fact and fiction .
I 'm half John Connor and half Christian there. '

Bale said he and Hurlbut quickly put the incident behind them .

' I 've not only talked with him , we have resolved this completely that very day, ' he said .
' We kept working for a number of hours .
Listen , when I 'm saying I 'm not coming back from that set if he 's hired , you know what , it 's hot air .
I do n't believe that .
I have no intention of getting anybody fired. '

Bale and Hurlbut worked together as recently as last month , he said .

' Everything is resolved between us, ' he said .
' There is no problem whatsoever. '

Bale said there was no physical violence against Hurlbut , especially considering he 's 'an ex-friggin'-football player. '

The actor insisted he does not have an oversized ego .

' Please , if anybody ever sees that I really am thinking that I 'm better than anybody else , stick a fork in my backside , turn me over , I will be done .
That is not me. '

He said he has not yet adjusted to 'this notion of being a movie star. '

' I 'm an actor and I do n't quite know how to handle this movie star thing, ' he said .

Bale said he called KROQ-FM 's morning show because they made him laugh with their jokes about him .

' I also appreciate you making fun of it, ' he said .
' I had it coming .
Feel free to make fun of me at my expense .
I deserve it completely. '

The tape has become fodder for late night talk show hosts and morning DJs since it was put out on the Internet last month .
