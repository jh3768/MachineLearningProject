January 23 , 2008 I 'm back to work now after the Christmas break .
The holiday was slightly extended for me as I had a friend over from Scotland and we decided to do a bit of traveling and see some of Tanzania 's famous landmarks .

We took a bus from Musoma over to a place called Pangani , which is on the East coast of Tanzania , stopping off in Arusha and Tanga .
The roads were in pretty bad condition and the journey was long , but the views through the Serengeti and Ngorongoro made it all worthwhile .

We passed lots of buffalo , zebra , some hippo and lions , but due to the speed of the bus , could n't get a proper look so decided while in Arusha to do a safari of Arusha National Park .

Part of the safari was on foot , which was great as that gave us the chance to get really close to the animals ( thankfully we were escorted by an armed ranger ) .
Being surrounded by Mount Meru , Mount Kiliminjaro and hoards of wild African animals has to be one of the best settings in the world .

The coastline along the east of Tanzania would give it a run for its money , though .
It is just stretch upon stretch of idyllic beaches overlooking the Indian Ocean .
The area of Pangani is a lot less touristy than Zanzibar so you pretty much have the beach to yourself .

All relaxed and replenished , we boarded a bus back to Musoma .
There were only two seats free right at the back of the bus ( crammed between a lot of people and a lot of bags ) , but my friend had a plane to catch so we had no choice but to board .
With every pothole we hit we were propelled into the air , and at one point the bus hit a ditch and almost toppled over so everyone started jumping out of the windows .

I was glad to arrive back in Musoma in one piece .
