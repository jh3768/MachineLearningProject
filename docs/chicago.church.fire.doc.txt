Fire damages historic Chicago church - CNN.com
CHICAGO , Illinois ( CNN ) -- Fire early Wednesday caused extensive damage to the roof and attic of the Holy Name Cathedral , fire and church officials said , but the sanctuary of the beloved 134-year-old city landmark and seat of Chicago 's archdiocese was spared .

Cardinal Francis George , who said the cathedral 's roof would probably have to be rebuilt , said a firefighter strained his back , but there were no other reports of injuries .

' Chicago has always bounced back from fires , and I think we 'll bounce back from this one, ' he said .

The blaze stunned parishioners such as Lary Ligas , who said 'it 's not just a Catholic church .
It 's part of Chicago. '

Starting about 5 : 30 a.m. CT , the fire raged for 2&frac12 ; hours until firefighters extinguished it .

There was extensive water damage , authorities said .

George noted that water poured from the roof onto light and electrical fixtures , and there were icicles on the pews .
Fire Department spokesman Larry Langford said the sanctuary floor in front of the altar area was flooded with several inches of water , but the altar area was not damaged .

Langford said the ceiling inside the cathedral 'looks good .
The lights are still on inside. '

About a dozen fire trucks responded to the church at State and Superior streets .
Firefighters did an 'excellent ' job keeping the fire from spreading , Langford said , adding that the cause of the blaze was under investigation .

Archdiocese officials said the five cardinals ' hats , or galeros , suspended from the ceiling were drenched but remain intact .
Each hat had been raised after a cardinal 's death .

The fire started in an attic area where major repairs were being made .
Jimmy Lago , chancellor of the archdiocese , noted that work was being done on pillars in the cathedral and on some deteriorating wood high in the rafters .

Lago said a laborer was present at the time the fire broke out , but he did n't know whether he was working in the area where the fire started .

The cathedral had been closed for six months to undergo major structural repairs and had reopened at the end of August , church officials noted .
The current work was being done on support beams .

' It 's a huge setback for all the parishioners for the archdiocese, ' Ligas said .

The Gothic structure was built after the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 destroyed the former church .
Brooklyn , New York , architect Patrick Charles Keely designed the building , and the cornerstone was laid July 19 , 1874 .
