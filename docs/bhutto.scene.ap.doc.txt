Bhutto assassination transforms park into scene of horror - CNN.com
RAWALPINDI , Pakistan ( AP ) -- Mangled bodies lay in a pool of blood and pieces of clothing and shoes were scattered on the road .

Just minutes earlier , Benazir Bhutto had left in her white SUV after addressing cheering crowds at a Thursday afternoon election rally in a park .

Then those of us still in the park heard gunfire and an explosion .

An assassin had struck , killing Bhutto , blowing himself up and taking at least another 20 lives .
In Rawalpindi , a city steeped in political violence , the streets were bloody again .

The park where Bhutto made her last speech is the same one where the country 's first prime minister , Liaquat Ali Khan , was shot to death in 1951 .
It is named after him .

The northern city , where the military is based , is also where Bhutto 's father and former prime minister , Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto , was hanged in 1979 .
President Pervez Musharraf survived two bombing attacks here in 2003 .

Earlier that year , Khalid Shaikh Mohammed , alleged mastermind of the 9/11 attacks , was captured in Rawalpindi .

Thursday 's bombing blew the clothes off some of the victims .
The victims lay on the road outside the gate of a neighboring theater .
Two bodies were face down .
Another was blackened and badly mutilated .
Blood was everywhere .
A severed hand lay several yards away .

The air reeked of explosives .

A man who appeared wounded was slumped on the sidewalk about 50 yards from where the bomber was thought to have struck .
Another man in bloodied clothes sat nearby on the footpath , looking dazed .

' Doomsday has happened, ' said Chaudhry Mohammed Nazir , a Bhutto party activist , crying and still holding the green , red and black flag of Bhutto 's party in the January 8 parliamentary election .

A spontaneous , chaotic rescue effort began with people trying to pick up the dead and wounded .
Ambulances wove through the crush of people .
Police asked bystanders to stay away .

Bhutto was brought to Rawalpindi 's state-run Central Hospital , where dozens of police sealed the main gate , leaving Bhutto supporters outside waiting for news .

After a party leader announced her death -- and although there was no indication who was behind the attack -- the crowd erupted into chants of 'Musharraf is a dog .
' Many broke down in anguish .

Some smashed the glass door to the hospital 's emergency unit and poured in .
A woman wailed 'Baji Bibi, ' or sister Bhutto .

' Convey our hatred to the generals, ' a young man in the hospital corridor told reporters , accusing the army of being hostile to Bhutto 's party .

Iftikhar Ali Butt , a party activist , said he had seen the slain 54-year-old candidate on a stretcher .
Her neck was bandaged , he said , and her body was covered in a white sheet .
