Playing games without frontiers - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- Just as consumers are becoming increasingly tech-savvy , so are the brands that target them .

Puma calls sports fans with their favorite team ring-tone to connect them with 10 other fans every time their team scores .
The Discovery Channel lets online adventurers encounter live sharks via GPS .
A&amp ; E Television invites Facebookers to earn money by parking , legally or not , on their friends ' streets .
Domino 's Pizza challenges YouTubers to hunt down the Saab convertible they can buy on eBay for $ 9.99 .

But look behind the brands , and you 'll find the creative and technical engineers of these compelling ad campaigns , whose toolbox of ideas is overflowing .

' The technology is just a vehicle to adapt to how people spend their time , and to be a part of that experience, ' says David Rosenberg , director of emerging media for veteran advertising giant JWT .

One of JWT 's more spectacular campaigns took place on Manhattan 's 5th Avenue , home to the busiest New York branch of HSBC , 'the world 's local bank. '

HSBC offered up its own real estate to transform the building 's storefront into a living theater , where actors would repeatedly perform the same scene -- a beauty contest , a yoga expert , crazy football fanatics -- in three different windows .

Passers-by were invited to express their points of view on the scenes by texting via interactive SMS their personal reaction to what was going on in front of them , and these words were then flashed above the windows for all to read .
Other people would then react to these words , perhaps at the same time posing for the provocative paparazzi .

' There was a Web component as well, ' recalls Rosenberg , 'but it probably was n't as visceral as that experience , in a very localized way. '

Game start-up

The games people play today can be more or less complex , more or less branded , more or less interactive .

' Social interaction is made out of people and their imagination , communication and desire, ' say Kevin Slavin and Frank Lantz , the co-founders of Area/Code , a New York-based start-up founded in 2005 .

' You can play chess every single day and it will never get old .
That 's because it 's a system that allows people to interact with people -- through the stylized interaction of games. '

Area/Code 's most recent promotion , just launched in September 2008 , is the game Backchannel for MTV , in which players are simultaneous viewers of the live TV show 'The Hills .
' As people watch the show , they type live comments on the site and score points depending on how many fellow viewers click on their humorous , irreverent or insightful 'tags. '

' If you 're in the TV business , you either see [ the Internet ] as a threat--in which you have to compete for attention--or an opportunity , in which you can figure out how to get them to echo each other , make each other more meaningful, ' comments Area/Code .

' The reality is that TV does something that no other medium in the world does--it gets 5 or 10 million people to do the same thing at the same time .
The question is , how do you connect these people together ?
That 's what the Internet is good for .
The online world can take those 5 or 10 million people and connect them to each other to have experiences we 've never seen before. '

Running meters and shark-spotting

One of Area/Code 's most successful games is Facebook Parking Wars , named after the TV show that premiered on AETV , preceded by the social networking site on which it 's played , with more than 400,000 people signing up to play in two months .

Not only do players get credit for parking fantasy cars on their friends ' streets , they can collect fines by ticketing illegally parked vehicles on their own streets .
Some players reportedly even get up in the middle of the night to move their cars .

One of Area/Code 's cult games is Sharkrunners , which features real sharks swimming wild in the sea to be 'encountered ' and studied by players at the helm of imaginary research boats .

' No one came to us and said : 'We want to make a game that uses sharks with GPS receivers on their fins,' ' says Area/Code .
' [ The Discovery Channel ] asked for help in making Shark Week bigger. '

Other games have involved chasing both human and imaginary opponents through Manhattan intersections via GPS-equipped Boost Mobile handsets ; treasure-hunting through a city by scanning optic codes with Quest Wireless phone cams ; shooting and collecting mini purikura photo-stickers to earn points and become a Tokyo pop idol using Mobot image analysis technology .

Blurring tangible and digital

' People will look back at games produced between 1980 and 2000 or so , and think : Yes , it was strange , people used to play games that were trying to simulate the whole world right there on a computer screen , and they would play them alone, ' reflects Area/Code .

' We love those games , but we 're interested in everything that comes after that. '

It was this active interest that led to the birth of Area/Code three years ago .

' It was before the Wii , before Guitar Hero , and it was before a mass-adoption GPS phone here in the U.S., ' say Slavin and Lantz .

' But the steps that led to those innovations were clear to us .
In 2005 , it was obvious that the most interesting developing technologies were those which blur the line between the tangible and concrete ( the area ) and the digital and dynamic ( the code ) . '

They add : 'One thing we have n't worked with yet , but remain excited about , is RFID , when things start to connect with other things , or with people...'

Snailnet

Such is the value of real space , that even today 's hard-core Netizens are willing to forego the immediate gratification of real time -- swapping e-mail for 'snail mail. '

Boredomresearch has been showing off its high-tech carrier snails equipped with 20-millimeter radio-frequency identity ( RFID ) disc tags for its RealSnailMail experiment .

How it works : People e-mail a message to a dispatch center , which is then mechanically assigned to one of several gastropod 'agents, ' who eventually wanders across the 50-centimeter enclosure and drops it off on the other end , where another piece of hardware collects the message and promptly hurdles it back into cyberspace .

' You understand that a diminutive mollusc will be burdened with the task of forwarding your message and have given reasonable consideration to the value of your message, ' state RealSnailMail 's terms of use .

' You understand that a considerable time may elapse between sending a message and its receipt and have considered the implications of this for yourself and the recipient. '

With some 6,000 e-mails in the queue , the current average delivery time for a message is 83.22 days .

All that 's missing now is the branding .
