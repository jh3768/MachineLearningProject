CNN Heroes: Serving up second chances to the disenfranchised - CNN.com
BALTIMORE , Maryland ( CNN ) -- 'Heroin , cocaine , alcohol...whatever was on the table , I wanted it, ' recalls Baltimore native Tyrone Lewis , who struggled with drug addiction for most of his life .

His addictions made it impossible for him to hold a job very long .
For a time , he was homeless .

' After a while you just feel ... alone, ' says Lewis .
' That made me want to give up. '

But that all changed when he met Galen Sampson , a five-star chef who offered Lewis the chance to join Chefs in the Making , a culinary training program that offers jobs and education to people who 've been homeless , incarcerated or have struggled with addiction .
For Lewis , it was the chance of a lifetime .

' He was offering me a free education, ' Lewis says .
' What he was doing gave me hope. '

For many years , hope has been in short supply in parts of Baltimore .
While some areas have been revitalized , much of the city is plagued by crime , poverty and drugs .
According to the Census Bureau , nearly 23 percent of residents live below the poverty line and the city has an estimated 60,000 addicts .

As a chef at one of Baltimore 's elite hotels , Sampson often saw his employees struggling with these problems in their own families .
When he met his wife , Bridget , a writer who ran literacy programs in the city , he got involved with her work and wanted to do more .

' I was a chef ; that 's what I was good at, ' Sampson recalls .
' How could I apply what I did to help ? '

Sampson had always dreamed of having his own restaurant .
So in 2005 , he and Bridget decided to create a socially responsible business that could address some of Baltimore 's problems .
They decided that part of their restaurant would be a training program , and Chefs in the Making was born .

In many respects , Chefs in the Making is run like any other culinary school .
Apprentices take classes four hours a week and the rest of the time , they work at The Dogwood , Sampson 's restaurant , which also includes a deli and catering business .
Students not only earn a living and learn a trade , but they also build a job history .

The program has partnered with other programs to give apprentices additional support ; there 's even a counselor on staff who meets with them every couple of weeks .
For Tyrone Lewis , the restaurant itself is a refuge .

' Here there are no secrets, ' Lewis says .
' Most of us just know we are people who are trying to get our lives back together. '

Sampson admits this unorthodox approach had its skeptics .

' A lot of people think we 're crazy .
We 've pretty much put everything that we have into this project, ' he says .

But for Sampson , it 's well worth the risk .

' To see what our apprentices have been able to do here has been very rewarding .
I think we 're setting the foundation for something good, ' he says .

In 2008 , Chefs in the Making intends to provide training/jobs to more than 30 people .
Apprentices make up about 25 percent of the restaurant staff and Lewis ' own situation suggests what potential the program has to change lives .

' Ten years from now , I see myself owning a home , maybe owning my own business, ' he says .

It 's a future that he would n't have dreamed was possible before meeting Sampson .

' A lot of people say they want to help, ' says Lewis .
' Galen actually makes a difference. '
