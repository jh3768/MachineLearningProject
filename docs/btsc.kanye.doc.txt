Behind the scenes: Kanye rises to the top - CNN.com
NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- Kanye West is not an artist who is known for his modesty .

Listen to his current album , 'Graduation, ' which debuted at No .
1 on the Billboard charts , besting 50 Cent 's 'Curtis ' in a much ballyhooed face-off , and you 're more likely to hear the sounds of chests being thumped than backs being patted .

But Tuesday evening at GQ 's 50th-anniversary party at Cedar Lake , a club in Manhattan 's popular Meatpacking District , West was surprisingly gracious .

' I feel bad about beating 50, ' he said , 'but I feel good about being number one. '

According to Nielsen SoundScan , West to date has sold more than 957,000 albums .
Fifty , who has said that he 'd retire from rap if West was victorious , sold 691,000 copies in the past week .
Will 50 be heading to Shady Pines ?
His people would not 'confirm or deny his retirement. '

No matter .
The GQ party was as much a celebration of the magazine 's storied history as it was of West .
' He 's the perfect marriage between artistic integrity and mainstream, ' said GQ 's editor Jim Nelson .

Supermodel Cindy Crawford , who arrived solo in a silver micro-mini dress and matching pumps , gushed about the magazine and then quickly moved on to the 50-Kanye tiff .
She remained neutral .

' I love both of them, ' she said , referring to the rappers .
' I could never pick sides , but I heard Kanye kicked some serious butt .
50 should n't retire, ' she added .
' We still love him. '

West worked the red carpet in a white Calvin Klein suit and matching canvas sneakers .
His fiancee , Alexis , opted for a curve-hugging black number that looked more befitting a dominatrix than a bride-to-be .
As she quietly hovered in the background , West was showered with congratulations , hugs and handshakes , declarations of his genius and even a few who took to quoting his lyrics .

Earlier in the evening West reminisced about the days when he was n't so beloved .
After spending an entire summer perfecting his game , he tried out for his high school 's basketball team .
He made all of his shots , completed all of the drills , but was cut nevertheless .
The coach told him he was n't tall enough , the 5-foot-8 rapper recalled .
' And I keep feeling like all these awards shows , it 's just them telling me I 'm not tall enough .
It 's like what else do you want me to do ? '

He said some of his temper tantrums ( the latest backstage at the MTV Video Music Awards ) , stem from that moment .
They are less about his ego and more about his passion .
' I play to win .
I look at it like it 's a sport , man .
And all I 'm doing is basically screaming at the refs, ' he said .

Jay-Z , the rapper turned Def Jam executive , said that Kanye 's current success was owed to his obsessive work ethic .
' There are 75 iterations of 'Stronger, ' ' he said , referring to West 's current hit single .
' There are 16 versions of the 'Good Life .
' He cares more about the music than anyone. '

In recent days 50 Cent has alleged that Island/Def Jam purchased albums to bolster West 's sales .
It 's a charge that the label 's CEO , L.A. Reid , vehemently denied shortly before posing for photos with West on the red carpet .

' This is a very clean and legitimate success, ' said Reid .
Did he expect 50 to retire ?
' No , I expect him to go back into the studio and make a better album. '

Moments later , hip-hop mogul P. Diddy sauntered down the red carpet , toothpick firmly in mouth , black Gucci loafers gleaming .
Like Crawford , he refused to choose sides .

' I 'm very political, ' he said , grinning slyly , 'and this is a very emotional situation. '

Ever the businessman , Diddy quickly launched into a sales pitch about his new women 's fragrance , Unforgivable , which hits stores today .
' I had so much success with my men 's fragrance and the women were demanding their own fragrance , so I had to oblige them, ' he said .

He also had his own dares to make .
In a video that was released to YouTube earlier in the day , he challenged Jennifer Lopez , Gwen Stefani , Sarah Jessica Parker and any other female celebrity with a fragrance to a 'scent off. '

' I know mine will win, ' he said .
' I 'm going to invite all of them to my penthouse suite , and if any of their scents smell better than mine I 'll take 'em shopping and they can run up my credit cards .
' As of yesterday , none of the ladies had obliged .

British crooner James Blunt , of 'Beautiful ' fame , was also ready for his own showdown .
Blunt 's sophomore album , 'All the Lost Souls, ' was released on Tuesday and he joked that he was eager to take on 50 and Kanye .
' I 'm throwing my hat into the ring, ' he said .
' I 'm comfortable coming in from behind and if my album sells more than either of theirs this week , I will retire from the American music industry. '

West hit the stage shortly after 11 .
He did not come alone .
He was accompanied by a band , an elaborate string section , several back-up singers , a DJ , fog and a highly choreographed light show .
He ran through his past hits ( 'Gold Digger ' ) and current chart-toppers ( 'Stronger ' ) , whipping the crowd of tastemakers , fashionistas , and celebrities like Beyonce into a frenzy .

He danced .
He freestyled .
He thanked his fans profusely .
Halfway through his show , he wiped his brow and paused for a brief moment of reflection .

' To be a true champion, ' he said , 'You 've got to take out a champion. '
