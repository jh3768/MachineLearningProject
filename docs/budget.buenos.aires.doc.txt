Vibrant Buenos Aires can be easy on the wallet - CNN.com
BUENOS AIRES , Argentina ( CNN ) -- Vegetarians , beware .
It 's Wednesday night at the Garden House Hostel in Buenos Aires , Argentina , and the unmistakable scent of juicy slabs of meat on the grill is wafting through the halls , luring guests to its source .

On the patio , where the grill master is preparing the asado , or barbecue , an assortment of foreigners -- Aussies , Americans and Latinos -- sit around a faded wooden picnic table and in circles of plastic garden chairs , sharing liters of Quilmes beer and stories of their travels .

Inside , we fill a makeshift dining room set of folding chairs and tables , where bowls of salad and bottles of wine and beer compete for space with our plates , loaded with thick cuts of sirloin and plump sausages ( grilled vegetables are an option for herbivores ) .
Glasses clink amid salutations of 'que aprovecha, ' or enjoy , and the silence of determined eaters quickly falls over the room .

The scene plays out weekly at the hostel , near Buenos Aires ' market and antiques district of San Telmo .
The buffet cost about $ 10 U.S. for all the meat , salad and wine I could manage -- a steal when you throw in the hostel 's convivial atmosphere and hospitable staff .
Anyway , my friend and I were paying only about $ 30 a night for a private double , and beds in a dorm run about $ 10 a night .

In a time of declining currencies and global financial crisis , hostels are no longer strictly the domain of weary backpackers and college students .
With the money saved , even a middle-class American with a crumbling stock portfolio can enjoy a city like Buenos Aires -- known as the Paris of Latin America -- in a manner befitting a profligate jet-setter .

From museums and theaters to international cuisine and bumpin ' nightclubs , Buenos Aires has all the offerings of a major European city without the grim exchange rate .
Argentina 's 2001 economic crisis brought droves of bargain-hunting tourists to what was once regarded as Latin America 's most expensive city .

Prices have crept up since then , but it 's still a great value .
Amid the current global economic turmoil , the Argentine peso recently dropped to its lowest level in nearly six years .

Of course , the catch is snagging affordable airfare , but even that can be done through travel agencies or patient Web searches for package deals , provided your dates are flexible .
The market for weekly apartment rentals is also ripe for those seeking the experience of a home away from home .

Not that you 'll be spending much time in your room .
Just wandering the streets and plazas of this sprawling city , where remnants of the city 's colonial European history intersect with 21st-century chic , provides enough stimulus for the most jaded city dweller .

After a deep sleep induced by red meat and red wine , we were ready for the long walk across the city to la Recoleta , a neighborhood where cobbled streets separate towering nightclubs and upscale boutiques from early 20th-century churches , homes and the Recoleta cemetery , resting place of the city 's elite .

With more than 6,400 mausoleums wedged together , including that of former first lady Eva Duarte de Peron , the cemetery provides a glimpse into the opulence of the upper class without costing a penny -- unless you want to buy a map of the grounds for less than $ 2 .

From there , neatly manicured parks and green areas dotted with exercise classes and reading groups separate you from just a few of the city 's top-notch museums , including the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes , which asks for a suggested donation to gain entry .

Farther down Avenida Liberador , past rows of grand mansions belonging to foreign consulates , MALBA , or Museo de Arte Latinoamericana de Buenos Aires , offers free admission on Wednesdays , which gets you access to paintings and installation art by some Latin America 's foremost modern and contemporary artists .

Or maybe you just like to sit and watch the world go by .
Like many Latin American cities , Buenos Aires ' prime real estate for people-watching belongs to plazas and cafes .
A prime example is Plaza de Mayo , in the city 's Centro district , which is flanked by the president 's office , a Gothic cathedral and high-rise office buildings .
It offers a panorama of the city 's architectural evolution and an endless parade of portenos , as city dwellers call themselves .

Eventually , all the walking and ogling calls for a caffeine boost .
Luckily , you 're never far from one of the city 's numerous cafes , where three U.S. dollars often can buy you a strong cortado ( espresso ) or caf&eacute ; con leche and three medialunas , known stateside as croissants .

But if you 're like me , walking makes you hungry .
For those of us who require a more substantial daytime meal , many Buenos Aires restaurants offer prix-fixe meals , though one of the components is usually a drink instead of a dessert or starter .
Meal choices include sample sizes of meat , pasta or the signature milanesa sandwich , a breaded and fried slice of meat -- usually for no more than 25 or 30 pesos , less than $ 10 U.S .

Vegetarians are not entirely neglected in the city of steak .
Wandering the city 's upscale Palermo district , also the home of many retail bargain shops , you 'll find Arte Sana , a beacon of healthy eating that serves up vegetarian plates and blended juices .
Like many natural food joints in the States , a bowl of lentil soup or stir-fry is going to run you more than a McDonald 's value meal , but the cleansing aspect is well worth it after all the coffee and meat .

Then the night calls , with enough options to leave your head spinning .
But first , you need tango-ready legs .
Not a problem .
Myriad salons occupy Buenos Aires ' narrow , congested side streets , offering full leg waxes and more starting at $ 5 U.S. , depending on the cleanliness of the establishment .
I opted for the 30 peso range , about $ 9 U.S. Sure enough , the pain factor was the same as it is in the United States , but for a fifth of the price , I was able to grin and bear it .

Now I was ready for a whirl at a tango salon , considered by many a staple of a visit to Buenos Aires .
Those seeking an interactive experience can take free or cheap lessons in one of the city 's many salons and stick around for dinner while professionals take over the floor .

Others content to simply watch can opt for a show at any number of venues -- the legendary Caf&eacute ; Tortoni being one of the more expensive venues at about 70 pesos , or $ 20 U.S. , for a 90-minute show , plus a one-drink minimum .
Plenty more salons offer cheaper dinner and theater packages with performances of comparable bravura , minus only the historic and somewhat touristy feel of Tortoni .

I tried tango once and quickly realized I was better off sticking to the city 's lively bar and nightclub scene , which stands up to its counterparts in New York or London in terms of attitude , sweat and plata , or money .
Younger portenos like the ones you 'll meet at the hostel can steer you toward the best option , depending on the night .
We ended up at Museum in San Telmo , a converted mansion consisting of four levels overlooking a massive dance floor , for the after-work party , which , apparently , does n't start until after 12 .

On another evening , feeling the need for a brooding , mellow scene , we opted for live music .
Twenty pesos , about $ 6 U.S. , got us a table at Club Atletico Fernandez Fierro , home base of the bar 's namesake 12-piece act .

Led by a singer whose campy costume changes reflect the group 's schizophrenic brand of updated tango , FF employs accordions , violins and a stand-up bass to deliver a moody set that , in the eyes of this foreigner , evokes the porteno ethos : one foot in a romanticized past , the other awaiting its spotlight on the world stage .
