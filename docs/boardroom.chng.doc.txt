Spicy, feisty: Jocelyn Chng - CNN.com
SINGAPORE ( CNN ) -- Jocelyn Chng 's parents set up the business in the 1970s .
Fast forward to the early '90s... And at the age of 21 -- with the business faltering , and her father passing away -- Jocelyn took control .
She talks to The Boardoom 's Andrew Stevens .

Stevens : What did you think when you walked in and took over and said , 'Okay , this is now my responsibility. '

Chng : At that time there was no longer thinking of the needs or about the fear of making it successful .
It 's about how to do it , and how to do it best .

From the start Jocelyn dreamed of growing the business .

Stevens : Give me an example of what your parents were doing , that you immediately started doing differently .

Chng : They are very conservative , because the business by itself is very traditional , so they make the sauces using the secret recipe , and keep it to themselves .
And I say , 'No , you have to employ people , you have to empower , we have to get the right people to run the business. '

Stevens : You make it sound very easy .
It could n't have been that easy .

Chng : I always tell my siblings , my colleagues , business is just very simple .
You do n't have to think of it as very complicated .
It 's about the demand and supply .
It 's about understanding the customers , what they want .
And they understand what we are selling .

Stevens : I read a story that your competitors were taking bets on how long you 'd last .
Have you heard about that story ?

Chng : Yes !
Yes ! And some of them were telling me that they were just betting about six months that the company would close if I take over .

Stevens : I do n't know whether you can answer this , but was there one decision you made which turned things around and got things on an even keel ?
And you thought , 'We can do this ' ?

Chng : It 's really to open up and think out of the box , and to do things differently .
For me , I 'm not fearful of anything because I start from nothing .
So I dare to take risks .

Those risks appear to have paid off .
With Jocelyn 's production line -- which her mother helps oversee -- now in high gear , pouring out some 15 tons of sauce each day , distributing to more than 30 countries , with some 80 employees .

Stevens : Your father said to you as he was dying , Do you really want to do this job ?
Do you really want to take over the family company ?
How do you see your children coming into this company ?
Will it be totally their choice ?

Chng : I mean , of course they are always welcome , but if they find that they prefer to do other things , I think it 's better for them , so long as they are happy .

Either way , it seems Jocelyn Chng 's own recipe for business success has saved a family tradition , and spiced up the lives of many others .
