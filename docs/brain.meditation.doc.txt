How monks find their happy groove - CNN.com
Some monks have an amazing ability to generate a feeling of bliss and happiness when they enter a deep state of meditation .
Experts are learning some surprising discoveries about happiness by studying what happens in the monks ' brains when they lapse into that deep state of meditation .

Questions and answers Tell us about one of the subjects of this study .
Dr. Sanjay Gupta , CNN chief medical correspondent : Barry Kerzin was on the fast track as a physician at the University of Washington , and he gave it all up , moved to Tibet and became a monk .
He and some Buddhist monks like him have a unique ability that is proving very helpful to neuroscientists trying to understand how the brain feels happiness .
Kerzin did n't reject modern medicine .
He says the Dalai Lama has encouraged him to keep up his medical training , and he does .
He 's still a doctor .
But since becoming a monk , he 's without a car , a television , a microwave oven -- and yet he says his lifestyle leads to inner joy and that the other things do n't seem so important .
What did the study show ?
Gupta : Inside this MRI scanner , Kerzin meditates with such focused attention that he can generate his own bliss .
His good feelings show up in an area of the brain where researchers think happiness lives , the left prefrontal cortex .
Negative emotions such as fear and anxiety show up on the other side of the brain .
What do the monks think about when they 're manipulating their thoughts ?
Gupta : They focus very intensely on one thing .
It could be anything , but in most of this research , the monks focus on generating compassion .
It works very much like an on/off switch .
The transition in the brain is very pronounced .
Any of us can try to elicit happiness like this .
But the feelings we typically generate disappear in less than half a second .
Kerzin meditates up to 12 hours a day .
Somehow he and others well-practiced at meditation can manipulate the feelings to last for minutes and minutes and minutes , sustained over time .

What if you 're not a Buddhist and do n't meditate ?
Gupta : The effects are n't specific to meditation and Buddhism .
There are similar studies , with similar results , testing Christian nuns who pray intensely .
Religious involvement appears to reduce anxiety , depression and substance abuse , and increase longevity .
In fact , some studies tell us that two-thirds of all Americans use prayer to try and help healing .
Also , studies show religious people are happier than non-religious people .
In one study , 43 percent of people who attended a religious service weekly said they were 'very happy, ' but 26 percent of people who seldom or never went to a service said they felt that way .
And that pattern is consistent among all major religions .
