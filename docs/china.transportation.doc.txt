Do-it-yourself China - CNN.com
( Budget Travel ) -- China is one of those places where there has long been a real appeal to being on a tour .
Having expert help to organize the logistics ( and a bilingual guide on the ground ) takes some of the anxiety out of visiting what can be a fairly overwhelming country .

But now , with China 's drive to modernize , planning a trip yourself is getting easier .
The country 's tourism industry is undergoing dramatic improvements : More Western hotels are opening in major cities , taxi drivers are being encouraged to learn some English and bilingual travel agencies and Web sites are cropping up .
Booking your own transportation to and within China will not only give you more flexibility in deciding where to go , it 's also a way to save money .

Flying there

Many travel agencies that specialize in U.S.-China flights have deals with airline consolidators to sell bulk-rate tickets , which are cheaper than the fares found on the airlines ' Web sites but also usually more restrictive .
KDCal Travel , a travel agency based in Los Angeles , sells deeply discounted tickets to China on its Web site , uschinatrip.com .
Most tickets are on flights operated by airlines such as China Eastern and Cathay Pacific , and some have restricted travel dates and a minimum six-night stay .
After you input your travel dates and select a ticket , you have to wait a day or so for an agent to contact you about purchasing the fare .

If you have no idea what a good fare is , go to TravelSuperLink.com , where users post the prices they 've recently paid for tickets and where they bought them .
One passenger , for instance , paid $ 790 for a round-trip Boston-Shanghai ticket this spring on American Airlines , using a New York City travel agency called China Express International Travel &amp ; Tour ( 866/978-4542 ) .
The site also provides phone numbers for more than a dozen agencies with English-speaking sales assistants .

Internal flights

For travel within China , check the prices of flights on China-based travel search engines such as Ctrip.com and eLong.com , as they 're cheaper than what you 'll find on Expedia or even on Kayak .
Ctrip and eLong -- both of which are in English -- have deals with domestic carriers to offer reduced prices for tickets , usually with restrictions such as no refunds for cancellations and fees for changing travel dates .

The sites also sell one-way tickets , allowing you to search different airlines for the lowest possible fare for each leg of a trip .
For example , Expedia 's lowest fare for a round-trip ticket between Shanghai and Beijing on Air China in June was $ 365 .
For the same dates , eLong turned up a total price of $ 224 for two one-way tickets between the cities , one leg on Shanghai Airlines and the other on Air China .

Buying tickets from these companies is relatively easy .
Both sites accept international credit cards and issue e-tickets .
For eLong , however , you 'll also have to e-mail or fax copies of your credit card and passport to the ticket office in China before the ticket is issued ( jpts @ corp.elong.com , fax 011-86/10-6432-7913 ) .

Train travel

New CRH bullet trains , which reach speeds of up to 185 miles per hour , have shortened the travel time on the rails between many tourist centers in China .
The trip between Shanghai and Suzhou is just 40 minutes on the CRH ( from $ 7 for a round-trip ticket ) , compared with two hours on the local train .
The bullet train between Beijing and Shanghai ( from $ 92 for a round-trip ticket ) takes 10 hours -- six hours less than the local train .

The best way to book round-trip tickets is to e-mail or call a travel agency in China .
Kingdom Travel in Beijing will arrange tickets up to 10 days in advance for a $ 7 fee and deliver them to your hotel ( 011-86/10-5870-3388 , kingdomtravel.com.cn ) .
Some hotels will also get tickets for you , but they may only handle one-way fares .

Buying your own tickets is an option , though train stations in China are chaotic , with lots of jostling and line jumping .
Unless you know a few choice words in Mandarin , you might want to spare yourself the trouble .
