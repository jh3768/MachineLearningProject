The 23-year-old mother and 24-year-old-father were not identified .

Otto Gaschler , deputy chief of youth services in Unterallgau , where the parents live , said the family was n't split up for too long .

Gaschler said a social worker is looking in on the reunited family .

' The parents saw the bid as a joke, ' Gaschler said .
' It was like a game for them .
They never thought that this stupid joke could have such an effect. '
