Court tosses 'wardrobe malfunction' fine - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- A Philadelphia appeals court Monday threw out the $ 550,000 indecency fine levied on CBS in connection with Janet Jackson 's infamous 'wardrobe malfunction ' at the 2004 Super Bowl .

Judges said in the court ruling that one of the determining factors was that they considered Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake 'independent contractors ' and CBS could not be held accountable for their actions .

The fine was levied by the Federal Communications Commission after one of Jackson 's breasts was exposed briefly during a performance with Timberlake during halftime of the Super Bowl .

Also the judges said it was impossible to determine how many complaints CBS received after incident .

In court filing , the FCC said the network received more than 542,000 complaints -- an 'unprecedented ' number .
But CBS disputed the number of and significance of complaints , claiming that 85 percent of them came from form letters generated by well-organized single-interest groups .

' The record is unclear on the actual number of complaints received from unorganized , individual viewers, ' the ruling said .
' The FCC can not impose liability on CBS for the acts of Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake , independent contractors hired for the limited purposes of the halftime show. '
