Next phase of working at home: Leaving home - CNN.com
ROSWELL , Georgia ( CNN ) -- More than a decade after the Internet allowed millions of people to work at home , the next phase of telecommuting involves , well , not working at home .

Organized 'coworking ' -- the concept of working solo alongside like-minded independents -- has spread to dozens of cities .

The irony of coworking is n't lost on organizers , including Kevin Bachman , who set up a group north of Atlanta as part of an informal Web-based network called Jelly .

' The reason people work alone , is because they 're looking for freedom, ' said Bachman , a 34-year-old Web developer who telecommutes part time .
' It may be ironic that you crave isolation , but you also want to be socially interactive with others like you. '

Once a month , Bachman 's group takes over a room provided by Tony 's American Grille &amp ; Tap .
A handful of home-based Internet workers hunch over laptops writing code , tweaking administration systems or enhancing databases .

' It 's a great way to get out of your bubble, ' said Bachman .

Tony 's doubles as a neighborhood sports bar at night , complete with a 'beer pong ' game table and projection TVs .
But during the day , this location takes on a more business-like tone as colleagues help each other work , said Randall , a freelance database programmer who would n't give his last name .

' I 've probably gotten some tips just today from people that had the same problems that I 've had, ' he said .
' So , all-in-all it 's been a productive day and it 's not even 2 o'clock yet. '

Coworking also provides an oasis for nomadic coffee-bar campers who struggle to collaborate among a random crowd .

' Starbucks was a place to get out of the house and be around other people, ' said Sherry Heyl , a Jelly coworker and home-based social media consultant .
' But you ca n't turn to the person next to you at Starbucks and say , 'Can you look at this proposal and tell me if it looks all right or check it for typos ?

Coworking is gaining popularity as number of single-person businesses in the United States is skyrocketing .

The nation added nearly 4 million one-person businesses between 2000 and 2005 , according to the U.S. Census Bureau .

Back in 2005 , Web programmer Javan Makhmali said he was 'missing the work atmosphere to get me in the zone -- to get work done ' at his home office in Portland , Oregon .
So he and a few friends created a coworking cooperative and called it -- appropriately -- Less Distracted .

' We found a space in a cool warehouse , put an ad on craigslist and Less Distracted was pretty much born like that, ' said Makhmali , a 27-year-old computer programmer .

By early 2006 , a 1,500 square foot space in the North Coast Seed building was filled with more than a dozen other programmers and designers looking to break out of their home offices .

In exchange for a $ 100 deposit and $ 150 per month for utilities , tenants get 24/7 use of DSL Internet , Wi-Fi , a kitchenette and a hang-out area with couches for meetings and relaxing .

The Less Distracted Web site describes it as 'your own space that 's not in your living room and certainly not a cube. '

Ryan Tyler , another original tenant , said coworking made a huge improvement in his productivity , while allowing him to make quite a few friends and great business contacts through the office .

The idea that home-based workers are returning to officelike environments is n't surprising to close followers of the commercial real estate business .

' For at least 50 years 'experts ' have said technology will eliminate office demand, ' said real estate consultant Prof. Peter Linneman of the Wharton School of Business .
' But the evidence clearly shows that we use ever more office space as technology advances. '

Coworking suits the lifestyle of Portland 's many free-spirited self-employed workers , said 39-year-old Tracey Weidner , an independent private investigator who 's been managing Less Distracted for about a year .
' It wo n't replace the corporate mentality of a traditional office , but it fills a need. '

Makhmali displayed some of that free-spiritedness when he started holding movie screenings on the warehouse 's seventh-floor roof .
Safety concerns prompted the building 's owner to close down the makeshift theater .

' The working vibe was something that we all created just by being there, ' said Makhmali , who has since moved to California .
' We all encouraged each other to stay focused and keep working. '

But Makhmali 's Less Distracted experience did n't create a permanent convert to coworking .
These days , instead of coworking , he 's simply working .

Makhmail said it 's 'a real job, ' programming for an education-based Los Angeles software firm ... in the company 's office .
