The proper role of business in a democratic society is to serve the public ( and future generations , through care for the environment and the state the world is passed down to them ) and not to lead it .
But business has often , in times of crisis , found itself in a natural alliance with authoritarian and populist states .
So what can Davos do in these multiple crises ( finance , energy , environment , poverty ) to avoid comfortable alliances with authoritarianism and promote a democratic positioning of business and its role in wider society ?
-- Open Democracy
