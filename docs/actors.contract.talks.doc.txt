SAG president: Stop that strike talk - CNN.com
LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) -- The Screen Actors Guild has told its 122,000 members to stay on the job even if the union fails to reach a deal with film and television studios before their contract expires at midnight Monday .

SAG President Alan Rosenberg said no strike vote has been planned , and the union 's negotiators are 'coming to the bargaining table every day in good faith. '

' Any talk about a strike or a management lockout at this point is simply a distraction, ' he said .

The talks have been complicated by a split between SAG and the smaller American Federation of Television and Radio Artists , which has reached its own agreement with the studios .
About 44,000 of AFTRA 's 70,000 members belong to both unions , and SAG leaders have urged those members to vote against the deal .

But AFTRA President Roberta Reardon said her union 's agreement is 'a solid deal ' that should be ratified -- and she blasted SAG for trying to influence her members .

' The trust between these two unions is really broken, ' she said .
' We did not want to be in a situation where we were spending all our time negotiating with our partner rather than negotiating across the table with our employers. '

SAG argues that the agreement between AFTRA and the studios provides no increase for DVD residual payments and would weaken both unions by allowing for nonunion new media production .

' This would set up AFTRA as the cheaper , more producer-friendly alternative in new media, ' SAG argued in a written statement .
' When unions compete with different contract terms , actors lose .
It starts a race to the bottom that SAG does n't want to win. '

Reardon said the fight 'has caused a great deal of confusion in the membership. '

' My dues money as a SAG member is being used against me , and I did n't have a vote in it, ' she said .

Film and television writers ended a 100-day strike in February after a contract was reached that included use of writers ' work on the Internet .
Dozens of films and TV shows were stalled by that strike .
