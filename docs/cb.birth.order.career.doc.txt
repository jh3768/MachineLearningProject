Can birth order determine your career? - CNN.com
Ah , sibling rivalry .
Relentless competitions , name-calling , hair pulling and blame shifting plague households with two or more children everywhere .
Ca n't we all just get along ?

Well , sure , sometimes .
But the reality is that all siblings are n't created equal and they do n't get treated as such .

Firstborns , for example , often get shafted because parents are stricter with them , while later-born kids might have fewer rules .
Everyone knows that the youngest seems to get away with murder because parents have seen it all before .
And where 's the middle child in all of this ?
Forgotten or overlooked .

Depending on birth position , there are special roles within families , leading to different adaptation patterns and different personalities , says Ben Dattner , a New York City-based organizational psychologist .

As a result of a stricter upbringing , for example , firstborn children tend to be more extroverted and confident , while second-born kids are more rebellious and open to new experiences , he says .
The youngest child is usually the most creative and can be manipulative to get his or her way .

Clearly , birth order affects personality , but what about career advancement and success ?
Several studies show that firstborns and only children usually reach higher educational goals , obtain greater prestige and acquire more net worth , while the middle child is likely to struggle a bit more .

' A child 's position in the family impacts his personality , his behavior , his learning and ultimately , his earning power, ' says Michael Grose , author of 'Why Firstborns Rule the World and Last Borns Want to Change It. '

' Most people have an intuitive knowledge that birth order somehow has an impact on development , but they underestimate how far-reaching and just how significant that impact is. '
