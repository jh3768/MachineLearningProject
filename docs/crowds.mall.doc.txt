Washington visitors looking to be part of history - CNN.com
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- They came from around the world , braving bitterly cold temperatures , security perimeters and large crowds in the streets of the nation 's capital to see one man make American history .

And even though Barack Obama was about 40 miles north on a whistle-stop train tour Saturday , they descended on the National Mall , where more than 2 million people are expected to gather for Tuesday 's presidential inauguration .

Some came from nearby states , others from the Washington area .
But for one man , Obama 's victory was worth traveling halfway around the world .

Abou Koudar hails from the Comoros Islands , off the coast of Mozambique .
Koudar said he was invited by the U.S. ambassador to Madagascar to witness Obama -- whose father was from Kenya -- take the oath of office .

' This victory is not only a victory for race but the whole world .
It 's not only black or white .
It 's everybody .
It 's a very meaningful victory for the world , because this is the first time the whole world is just watching .
It 's unbelievable, ' he said through interpreter Salah Djimbmaou .

Koudar , who joked that he is something of a reporter to friends and family looking for news , was taken aback by the low temperatures , which hovered in the teens Saturday afternoon .

' Oh , my goodness !
Oh , my goodness !
' he said with a laugh as his entire body shivered .

For Katrina Peoples , the visit to the Mall was a preview of Tuesday .

' We 're here today to do a dry run .
We 're preparing for whatever, ' said Peoples , of Greensboro , North Carolina .
' We had to come to see this historic event .
You just have to come .
It 's like a beacon to come here. '

Peoples volunteered for Obama in North Carolina , a normally solid-red state that went for the Illinois senator .
She said she will stay with a friend in Bowie , Maryland , and head in by way of Washington 's Metro system .

But for the visitors around the U.S. Capitol , it was much more than just sightseeing ; it was an opportunity to walk the ground where history will be made .

' I would n't have missed this for the world , and to think what this country has been through and where we can go, ' said Howard Lurie , who traveled with his family from Brookline , Massachusetts .
' I think we 've taken so much for granted , and it 's so much to be here ... such a moment to experience the crowd and see everyone else standing out in the cold. '

Lurie 's sister Ellen Lurie-Hoffman , who lives in Bethesda , Maryland , said there 's an electricity in the air -- and she had to be a part of it .

' My husband and I were here for both of Clinton 's inaugurations .
... This just feels different .
It feels like the whole country is just ready to celebrate , to see a serious change and new direction, ' she said .

Hoffman said her trip into Washington on Saturday was a chance to show her family the preparations being made in case they do n't get a chance to stand on the parade route Tuesday .

' If it 's too cold , we might not go .
We wanted to drive down today to show our out-of-town visitors the festivities and port-a-potties and scaffolding .
It 's just exciting to see so many different people who 've obviously convened from all over the country , from all walks of life. '

And that includes many students , who turned out in droves for Obama 's campaign .

' So far , it has been very cold but absolutely incredible .
... I would have better words , but I 'm in awe of it .
It will probably sink in later, ' said Lucia Mock , who attends Wheelock College in Boston , Massachusetts .
' Being here while it 's empty and imagining millions of people .
I do n't think I 'll be able to miss it .
Its just too incredible. '

Mock , who came to Washington for a seminar , will have a big headache come Tuesday : She has to catch a 4 p.m. flight back to Boston .

Jimia Harris , a student from the District , said she is 'speechless ' at the notion that the country will have its first African-American president .

' To see an African-American man hold such a high position in office and to be here to support him , it 's actually a memorable moment -- to actually be a part of history .
We never thought this would ever happen , ever. '
