White House race drama continues despite tight script - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- U.S. political parties ' conventions are relics .
They do n't decide the nominees any more .
That 's been turned over to primary voters .
And no one pays much attention to party platforms except a few ideological activists .

So why do we still have them ?
Two reasons : money and publicity .

Parties can raise big money at conventions .
Major contributors are treated to endless receptions and special events .
The actual convention business -- nominations , acceptance speeches , platforms ( party programs ) -- easily could be completed in a weekend .

But the process is stretched out over four days to provide plenty of time for fundraising .

The convention has evolved into a four-day 'infomercial, ' a slick production aimed at promoting the candidate and giving the ticket a 'bounce ' in the polls .

It was n't always like that .
In 1972 , it was sensational news when the press discovered a detailed , minute-by-minute script for the Republican convention .

The Democrats had no such script and it showed .
The 1972 Democratic convention was far more 'democratic ' -- and chaotic .
The nominee ended up giving his acceptance speech in the middle of the night after days of infighting , with disastrous results .

Despite a bitter convention battle , George McGovern was nominated and went on to lose by one of the biggest margins ever .

Now both parties try to control every minute of the convention as if it were a television show .
Because it is a television show .

Delegates are props .
They cheer and applaud and provide 'color ' ( funny hats ) .
The last thing convention organizers want is actual news made .
But somehow news usually manages to break out .

Think of it this way .
At the Democratic convention in Denver , Colorado , a little more than 2,000 delegates for Sen. Barack Obama and a little under 2,000 delegates for Sen. Hillary Clinton will be meeting in one big room .
Singing 'Kum Ba Ya ' ?
Not likely .
They 'll find plenty of things to squabble over .

Obama plans to deliver his acceptance speech in a stadium with 76,000 seats instead of the conventional hall .
Here 's one reason : An audience of 74,000 Obama fans will swamp 2,000 Clinton delegates .

Republicans have two big worries for their convention .
One is what to do with President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney -- two of the most unpopular figures in U.S. politics .

Bush and Cheney have to be given time to say farewell to their party .
When they do , Sen. John McCain wants to be far away .
Otherwise , he would be expected to raise arms with Bush and Cheney -- and provide a photo that would live forever in Democratic campaign propaganda .

Conservative activists are determined to write a party platform that limits McCain 's influence .
Meaning , no stem cell research .
No global warming .
No campaign finance reform .
No comprehensive immigration reform .
Convention organizers want to make sure the platform process , like the Bush and Cheney speeches , gets as little notice as possible .

Nevertheless , if you look beyond the hoopla and the bombast at the conventions , a real story will be going on .
It is about the remaking of the Democratic and Republican parties .

The Democratic Party has been the Clinton party for 16 years .
Now the Obama campaign wants to remake it into the Obama party .

The process started just after Obama claimed the nomination .
He moved major party operations from Washington to Chicago , Illinois , where his campaign is headquartered .
He ordered the party to stop accepting contributions from groups that lobby the federal government .

In the United States , political parties are diverse coalitions united by one thing : the desire to get the party 's candidates elected .

Coalitions are held together by calculation and strategy .
The Clintons were extremely good at calculation and strategy .
Remember 'triangulation ' -- President Clinton 's technique of splitting the difference with people on both sides of an issue ?
And the Clintons were winners .
Until this year .

This year , Hillary Clinton was defeated by something the Clintons did n't see coming -- a political movement .

A movement is held together by more than calculation and strategy .
A movement is based on belief and belonging .
People support a campaign .
But they belong to a movement .
Movements can be difficult to elect .
They alienate 'nonbelievers ' who do n't feel they 'belong. '

The Democratic convention will be the first formal meeting of the national Obama movement .
We 'll be watching to see how the Obama campaign tries to reshape the party 's image and message .
And whether the Clinton delegates put up resistance .

Precisely the opposite will be happening at the Republican convention .

The Republican Party was captured by the conservative movement when Ronald Reagan won the nomination in 1980 .
The conservative movement nominated George W. Bush and rejected McCain in 2000 .

Now the McCain campaign wants to remake it from a Bush party to a McCain party .
That means limiting the influence of movement conservatives who have controlled the party for nearly 30 years .

McCain wants the Republican Party to be a party of reform , not just conservatism .
That way he can look like a candidate of change instead of a third term for Bush .
That 's a calculation and a strategy .
It 's also a challenge to conservatives .

McCain will try to remake the Republican Party in his image , and conservatives may resist .
That will provide much of the drama -- and the news -- at the Republican convention in Minneapolis-St. Paul , Minnesota .
