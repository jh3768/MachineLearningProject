Could Egypt be the next world export hub? - CNN.com
CAIRO , Egypt ( CNN ) -- Egypt has realized it needs to create more jobs , more factories and more exports -- and fast .

In many other countries , industrial zones nurture the sector by grouping a number of factories serving a single business or industry together .

But for many years , Egypt 's government has been in charge of industry and has n't always chosen to organize the sector for maximum efficiency .

' There were no consistent industries , and services were very primitive because you have a soap factory and a car factory and a garment factory nearby .
Services would n't be provided to a higher level to what the industrial investors will be expecting, ' said Karim Sami Saad , Chairman of Engineering Square .

Now , Cairo is trying to invigorate industry in a different way .
By putting investors -- like Karim Saad -- in charge of the country 's industrial sector in the hopes it will become more efficient .

Having industrial zones run by the private sector marks the start of a new approach to this part of Egypt 's economy .
The government is right behind the project which started gathering momentum in 2007 .

' Private sector can do it better .
They can do it faster , they can do it more efficient and they actually do the marketing much better, ' Rachid Mohamed Rachid , Egyptian Minister of Trade and Industry told CNN .

Each zone will be large and targeted to a specific industry .
Saad 's sector is an auto manufacturing zone and it is projected to start making cars within the next nine months .

Egypt is also ideally placed as an export hub , which many private investors see as a win-win opportunity .

' US market you can access from Egypt without duty , to European Union you can access without any duty , to Africa you can access without duty and Arab countries you can access without duties, ' said Tunc Ozkan , chairman of Polaris International , an international affiliation of independent accounting and consulting firms .

Ozkan is part of the team heading up a new garment manufacturing district where many of the businesses have Turkish ownership .
It is known as the Turkish Zone .

Nine zones are currently being built with a goal of 25 by the end of next year and a projected figure of 5,000 factories in under a decade .

' If we can get to that situation , that will represent a very significant chunk and percentage of our industrial output -- which is growing at a rate of 8.5 percent per year -- and I could see that this is going to represent something like 80 to 90 percent of all our industrial new investments, ' Rachid said .

But boosting exports is just one of the goals for these industrialized zones .
The other is creating jobs for tens of thousands of Egyptians over the next 18 months .

Currently , official unemployment is running at just under 10 percent -- unofficially the number may be closer to 15 percent -- which means there is a big supply of workers for the zones .

Over the next year and a half the zones are expected to create over 80,000 new jobs .

' This is going to be one of the most effective tools for us to fight unemployment, ' says Rachid .

Ozcan believes that as a private investor it is important to bear in mind that putting funds into Egypt 's new industrialized zones is not about making quick money .

' This is not an opportunity to come and go .
You have to stay here .
You have to understand the nature of the people here and you have to waste a little time here to understand these circumstances, ' he told CNN .

If you do , Egypt 's government says , the profits will be well worth the wait .
