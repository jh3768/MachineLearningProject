How to drive without burning money - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- Gas prices have been surging to record highs .
But it 's not just the gas bill that drivers are getting socked with .
The costs of car insurance , tires , licensing and registration are on the rise , too .
But there are some strategies you can use to cut the cost of owning your car .

Maintenance

Consider where you get your car serviced .
Instead of going to your dealership for repairs , try going to an independent garage , says Phillip Reed of Edmunds.com , an online automotive Web site .

The repair is n't necessarily cheaper , but dealerships often push you to replace or repair things that are n't immediately necessary , he says .
So instead of having your transmission fluid changed at 80,000 miles as the manufacturer recommends , your dealership may pressure you to change it at 15,000 miles .

' Every time you go in to a dealership , they are trying to add in extra things and then charging more to do them, ' Reed says .
' The profit from a dealership moved from the front end to the back end .
' Since cars are n't selling at such high profit margins anymore , dealers are looking at how they can recoup that money through service costs .

Do n't buy into maintenance myths .

It 's been a mantra for generations : Change the oil every 3,000 miles .
But before you pull into your local lube garage , take a look at your car 's manual .
Most auto manufacturers recommend you change the oil after 7,500 miles , Reed says .
That 's more than double the old standard .

You should change your oil at least twice a year , before the summer driving season and before the first snowfall , says Tony Molla of the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence , a nonprofit group for car repair and service professionals .
Of course , if you drive under severe conditions , you may need to change your oil more frequently .

And keep in mind , if you use synthetic oil over conventional car oil , you can get more mileage out of your car .

And before you spring for the new tires at your dealership , go online .
You can save big bucks by buying your tires over the Internet and having them shipped to your garage .
Reed saved $ 112 by going to www.tirerack.com .
Enter some specifics about your car , and you 'll get a list of tires and their prices , plus performance reviews from other customers .

Auto insurance

Insurance rates are rising for the first time since 2006 , according to Insurance.com , an online insurance agency .
But there are ways to cut your premium .

First , make sure you maintain a good credit score .
Most car insurers filter your credit information into a formula to determine what your 'insurance risk score ' is .
This score determines how likely you are to file a claim .
The lower your credit score , the higher premiums you 'll pay .

So , keep paying your bills on time .
If it 's been a while since you 've updated your car insurance , it 'll be worth checking your credit score .
If your score has improved , let your insurer know .
You may be eligible for a lower premium .

And what you do for a living counts , too .

Allstate Insurance gives discounts for people in certain low-risk professions in a handful of states .
So if you 're a mail carrier , a biologist , a vet , a speech therapist or an economist in Alabama or South Carolina , you 'll get 8 percent off your insurance .

And if you 're locksmith , an artist , a clergy member , an accountant or a teacher , you 'll qualify for a 5 percent discount .
Police officers and firefighters can also get a 5 percent discount in Wisconsin , Illinois and Minnesota , and paramedics are eligible for a 10 percent discount .

Horace Mann Insurance also offers discounts to teachers who belong to state education associations or the National Education Association ( NEA ) .
These discounts start at 8 percent .
Teachers under 30 can get discounts of 10-15 percent .

Updating your needs can also yield you some savings .

If you have a car that you 've been driving for more than 5 years and it 's not worth much more than $ 5,000 , consider dropping collision or theft insurance , Reed says .
You will take on more risk , so if you have a lot of assets to protect or a family to consider , you may want to think twice about this option .
But if you are single and do n't have a lot of assets attached to your name , you could save 30-50 percent off the bat on your insurance .

And do n't forget to double up .
Buying your auto insurance and your home insurance from the same place can save you 10 percent at some companies .
Many insurers have multi-policy discounts .

Even if you 've been with your insurer for years , you may not know about a lot of other discounts that your company offers , says Sam Belden of Insurance.com .
They include :

& # 8226 ; Low-mileage discount : If you drive less than a certain amount of miles per year .

& # 8226 ; Good student discount : If your teen has a B average or above , you can get 10-20 percent off .

& # 8226 ; Professional groups : Your AAA membership , union , fraternal organization or alumni association may get special group discounts .

& # 8226 ; Take a defensive driving course : Most insurers will give you a break on your premium if you take an approved defensive driving class in your area .

Making your car last

Want to improve your car 's longevity ?

Do n't let your gas tank needle get to empty , says Molla , who does n't let his car fall below half a tank .
When your tank runs on fumes , sediment collects at the bottom of the fuel tank over time .
And this sediment could clog or damage parts .

And keeping your car above half a tank has another psychological perk .
' It 's like you 're only paying for half a tank when you fill up, ' Molla says .

Another important tip : Make sure your tires are inflated properly .
Not only will you save gas , but your tires will wear more evenly and will be less likely to fail at high speeds , according to road tests done by Edmunds.com .

Finally , make sure you tighten that gas cap .
If you do n't tighten up the cap to the second click , gas can evaporate .
And with the cost of gas these days , you ca n't afford to see your money go up in fumes .
