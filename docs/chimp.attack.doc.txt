Police shoot, kill chimp that attacked woman - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- A woman has been hospitalized with serious injuries to her face , neck and hands after a pet chimpanzee attacked her at a friend 's home in Stamford , Connecticut .

Charla Nash , 55 , had just arrived at her friend Sandra Herold 's house when the chimp , named Travis , jumped on her and began biting and mauling her , according to Stamford Police Capt .
Rich Conklin , who said the attack was unprovoked .

Herold had called Nash over to her house to help get Travis back inside after he used a key to free himself from the house .

After the attack , Herold was unable to pull the primate off her friend .
She then called 911 before grabbing a butcher knife and stabbing the chimp , who police said was like a child to her .

Stamford police shot the chimp multiple times when he ripped off a side mirror and tried to enter a police cruiser , Conklin said .
Travis returned to the house and died inside .

Conklin estimated Travis to be in his 20s , weighing close to 200 pounds .

The police captain also said this is n't the first interaction his officers have had with Travis -- the chimp escaped in 2003 and 'wreaked havoc ' on the streets of Stamford for a couple of hours .

In 2005 , a different chimp escaped from California 's Animal Haven Ranch and chewed off a man 's nose and genitals .

During an interview after that attack , wildlife expert Jeff Corwin told CNN 's Anderson Cooper that chimpanzees are 'absolutely powerful. '

' It 's often said that an adult chimpanzee weighing in at 150 pounds is three to seven times stronger than a human being, ' Corwin said .

' The thing about chimpanzees is , we sort of look at them through our rose-colored cultural glasses of the cute little chimp in the 'Tarzan ' movie .
Those are very young chimps .
Chimps grow up , they become very powerful .
They are very complex in their behavior .
They have a whole range of emotions , including violence and anger. '
