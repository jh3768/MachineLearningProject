Goalkeeper Cavalieri on way to Liverpool - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez is expecting to complete the $ 5.9 million signing of goalkeeper Diego Cavalieri from Brazilian club Palmeiras in the near future .

The player completed a medical and has acquired a work permit .
His agent Juninho Parmigiani said : 'We will conclude everything in the near future. '

Palmeiras sporting director Toninho Cecilio added : 'There are some clauses to be discussed but nothing that can now block the deal. '

Liverpool plan to sell their French goalkeeper Charles Itandje to Galatasaray for $ 3.9 million .

Cavalieri will be the reserve keeper as Jose Reina maintains the starting spot and it seems likely that England international Scott Carson will also be leaving Anfield .

Carson was on loan at Aston Villa last season but the midland side 's manager Martin O'Neill is not happy with Liverpool 's asking price of around $ 19.7 million for a permanent switch .

Newly-promoted Premier League side Stoke City would like to sign Carson but would have problems finding the fee .

Carson joined Liverpool from Leeds on a four-and-a-half year deal in 2005 .
He was Benitez 's first English signing but has spent most of the time on loan , turning out for Sheffield Wednesday and Charlton before the switch to Villa .

Liverpool will be keen to pick up money for a permanent transfer to help finance the signing of other targets , principally Carson 's former Villa colleague Gareth Barry .

The prolonged and often acrimonious discussions over Barry 's move are still developing on Wednesday .
Villa are believed to have said they will now accept $ 33.5 million plus Irish full-back Steve Finnan .
They would want half the fee immediately and the rest in 12 months .

Meanwhile , Liverpool are close to completing the sale of England striker Peter Crouch to Portsmouth on Wednesday for around $ 19.7 million .

Benitez praised Crouch 's contribution at Liverpool since his move from Southampton three years ago .
' I am proud of the progress he has made .
When we brought him here people were talking about the deal , especially because he did not score for several games, ' said Benitez .

' But he showed his quality , showed he was a good player and a fantastic professional .
We know we will miss him but you can not stop a player who wants to go. '
