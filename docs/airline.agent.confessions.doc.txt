Confessions of an airline agent - CNN.com
( Budget Travel ) -- When it comes to flight changes and delays , Budget Travel 's confessor says , 'sometimes the agent is the last one to know. '

No training New airline ticket and departure-gate agents are hard to find these days .
Not only are the wages awful , but flying for free -- the one perk of the job -- is becoming virtually impossible because planes are always packed with paying customers .

To save money , many airlines also are n't giving new employees the same job training they once received , leaving inexperienced agents on the front line to deal with passenger complaints .
Once , on a trip I took after I had stopped working as a ticket agent , I had to show a new hire where to look in the system to find my reservation -- she had no idea what she was doing .

Cut off The airline I worked for had a very antiquated computer system .
We had about a dozen operating systems in the company .
There were separate systems for mapping flight routes , filing lost-luggage claims , and keeping track of reservations -- but not all of them could relay data to each other .
To top it all off , the computers at the departure gates did n't have Internet access .

The popular belief among disgruntled travelers that gate agents purposely keep passengers in the dark about flight delays is n't really true -- sometimes the agent is the last one to know what 's going on .

Good behavior It used to be that if you tried a little smooth talking or even brought a cookie to the gate agent , you might be able to score an upgrade .
Not anymore .

Because the airlines are increasingly focused on the bottom line , free upgrades are incredibly hard to come by .
Still , it pays to be nice to the agents : After a few kind words , they may go out of their way to reroute you on a partner airline if your flight is delayed .

I turned on the charm myself one time when I was facing a long delay on the way to the Caribbean .
Smiling politely , I went to a partner airline 's ticket counter and asked the agent to please reroute me .
Several hours later , I was lying on the beach , sipping a tropical drink .

Personal info Ticket agents are always updating Passenger Name Records , or PNRs .
These computer files , which contain basic details on passengers ' trips , are accessible to most agents at check-in counters and departure gates .

Agents generally use PNRs to record special requests by passengers , but sometimes they also comment on a person 's behavior .

A friend of mine discovered this after she had a heated argument with a ticket agent about getting an upgrade on a flight to London .
When she reached her gate and inquired again , the agent remarked on her 'inappropriate behavior ' at check-in , and my friend was stuck with her economy-class seat .

The details in PNRs are also fodder for airline-employee gossip , especially when shocking behavior is involved .

Passengers once complained about a woman breast-feeding her Chihuahua ( I kid you not ) on board a flight , and an airport supervisor in the arrival city put the incident in her PNR .
Within hours , a gate agent came upon the PNR and shared it with countless other agents across the country .
In fact , my former colleagues and I still talk about it to this day !
