Games to save up for - CNN.com
So many games , so little time .

Such is still the case when running between Santa Monica , California , hotels at the Electronic Entertainment Expo , or E3 , the annual video game convention that serves as a peek into the future of the multibillion-dollar interactive entertainment industry .

This year 's invitation-only show , with about 3,000 journalists and analysts , was in other ways dramatically different than in years past , when more than 65,000 attendees would cram into the Los Angeles Convention Center to see the biggest game franchises of tomorrow .

Despite taking more time to get to meetings , this new format gave us a more relaxed environment with more hands-on time with games that are coming out later this year or next .

The buzz was unavoidable for upcoming games such as Bethesda 's Fallout 3 , Microsoft 's Halo 3 , Ubisoft 's Assassin 's Creed , Nintendo 's Super Mario Galaxy , Konami 's Metal Gear Solid 4 : Guns of the Patriots , Nintendo 's Wii Fit and 2K Games ' BioShock .
But the following were my top picks worth getting excited about :

' Rock Band'

Developed by Harmonix , the same folks who created the insanely popular Guitar Hero games -- where players plug a guitar-shaped controller into the game console and strum along with popular rock songs .
Rock Band turns it up to 11 , if you will , by adding more instruments and online play .
Specifically , this upcoming Microsoft Xbox 360 and Sony PlayStation 3 game not only supports a guitar peripheral but also includes a drum kit , bass guitar and microphone to sing classic rock tunes or newer hits .
Therefore , you and up to three friends can jam in front of your television , rocking out to these songs in order to rack up points and unlock new venues and on-stage characters .
You can also play together over the Internet in real time or download additional songs .
No price or launch date has been announced , but it will be published by MTV Games and distributed by Electronic Arts by year-end .

' Mass Effect'

Sure , sci-fi fans were buzzing about Halo 3 ( due out Sept. 25 ) , but Xbox 360 owners should be equally as excited about Mass Effect from BioWare , the latest and easily most ambitious role-playing game ( RPG ) from the developers responsible for Star Wars : Knights of the Old Republic and Jade Empire .
Due out this November from Microsoft Game Studios , Mass Effect is a deep fantasy RPG , where you roam the galaxy with allies brimming with life and personality .
Through strategic combat , puzzle-solving and thousands of lines of well-written dialogue , you must remain alive long enough to unravel a mystery and put a stop to an evil force preparing to wipe out all advanced life forms in the universe .
While visiting planets and space stations , all characters you interact with feature realistic facial animations that help them convey emotions .

'LittleBigPlanet'

Due out in early 2008 for the PlayStation 3 is Sony 's LittleBigPlanet , an ingenious community-based puzzle game , where you meet on a planet with individual plots and use your little characters , each with their own powers , to bypass obstacles and collect items by interacting with the environment .
You must also modify your surroundings and create objects , which can then be shared with others online via the PlayStation Network .
This collaborative teamwork game is no linear adventure : You can choose how to play and what to create , with virtually limitless combinations as you customize your patch of land , characters and objects , to solve the increasingly challenging exercises .
Visually speaking , this game is simply gorgeous with its 3-D puppet-like creatures and surreal but organic-looking worlds with high-resolution textures .

' Call of Duty 4 : Modern Warfare'

Activision 's Call of Duty 4 : Modern Warfare ( Xbox 360 and PC ) is an incredibly intense modern-day military shooter that drops you in hot spots around the globe as both a U.S. Marine and British Special Air Service soldier .
To take on the rogue enemy group that 's threatening the world , you will have access to more than 70 authentic weapons as well as accessories such as night-vision goggles and special protective suits .
Most of the cinematic action takes place on foot , as you must use the environment as cover ( such as walls , tall grass and cars ) , but gamers can also ride in helicopters and other vehicles .
Along with the lengthy single-player campaign , multiple online modes will keep the war alive in cyberspace .
This Mature-rated game is due out this fall .
