November 27 , 2007 Tomorrow , Dennis , 25 of the students and me leave for Mwanza to start our three-day sponsored cycle and World Disability Day celebrations .

The last couple of weeks have been pretty manic trying to get things organized .
It 's the first time I 've really been part of something like this , although a few years ago Dennis participated in a similar event , walking 260 kilometers ( 161 miles ) with two blind boys to raise money for a new blind school in Musoma .

On Wednesday at 7am , Mwanza 's District Commissioner flags us off for the first leg of the journey .

We 've organized for a police car to follow in front of us for safety , and an announcer to project details about the race and its purpose .

The main reason for the cycle is to heighten awareness of disabilities , but also to raise money for our new disabled center .
The students have been out and about in town all week collecting sponsorships and we 've been really pleased with people 's willingness to donate .

The day will also be a good opportunity to launch the new name of our facility : 'Lake Victoria Disability Centre ' , so I was keen to have the Web site completed .

The final day of our cycle will be on Sunday , December 2 ( World Disability Day ) , where we will be joined by a group of physically disabled with their tricycles to complete the race with us .

We 'll finish the race at the grounds where we have planned the sporting events and celebrations .

There will be games , speeches , traditional Tanzanian dancers and stalls selling local craftwork .
In the evening , one of Musoma 's leading hotels , Hotel Matvilla , has agreed to put on a dinner and dance for 250 of the disabled youths .

This is the first time something like this has taken place in Musoma .
