Things your body can do after you die - CNN.com
( Mental Floss ) -- From getting hitched to saving the environment , here 's proof you can still be a busybody long after you kick the bucket .

Get married

Death is no obstacle when it comes to love in China .
That 's because ghost marriage -- the practice of setting up deceased relatives with suitable spouses , dead or alive -- is still an option .

Ghost marriage first appeared in Chinese legends 2,000 years ago , and it 's been a staple of the culture ever since .
At times , it was a way for spinsters to gain social acceptance after death .
At other times , the ceremony honored dead sons by giving them living brides .
In both cases , the marriages served a religious function by making the deceased happier in the afterlife .

While the practice of matchmaking for the dead waned during China 's Cultural Revolution in the late 1960s , officials report that ghost marriages are back on the rise .
Today , the goal is often to give a deceased bachelor a wife -- preferably one who has recently been laid to rest .
But in a nation where men outnumber women in death as well as in life , the shortage of corpse brides has led to murder .

In 2007 , there were two widely reported cases of rural men killing prostitutes , housekeepers , and mentally ill women in order to sell their bodies as ghost wives .
Worse , these crimes pay .
According to The Washington Post and The London Times , one undertaker buys women 's bodies for more than $ 2,000 and sells them to prospective 'in-laws ' for nearly $ 5,000 .

Unwind with a few friends

Today , most of us think of mummies as rare and valuable artifacts , but to the ancient Egyptians , they were as common as iPhones .
So , where have all those mummies gone ?
Basically , they 've been used up .
Europeans and Middle Easterners spent centuries raiding ancient Egyptian tombs and turning the bandaged bodies into cheap commodities .

For instance , mummy-based panaceas were once popular as quack medicine .
In the 16th century , French King Francis I took a daily pinch of mummy to build strength , sort of like a particularly offensive multivitamin .
Other mummies , mainly those of animals , became kindling in homes and steam engines .

Meanwhile , human mummies frequently fell victim to Victorian social events .
During the late 19th century , it was popular for wealthy families to host mummy-unwrapping parties , where the desecration of the dead was followed by cocktails and hors d'oeuvres .

Tour the globe as a scandalous work of art

Beginning in 1996 with the BODY WORLDS show in Japan , exhibits featuring artfully flayed human bodies have rocked the museum circuit .
BODY WORLDS is now in its fourth incarnation , and competing shows , such as Bodies Revealed , are pulling in $ 30 million per year .
The problem is , it 's not always clear where those bodies are coming from .

Dr. Gunther von Hagens , the man behind BODY WORLDS , has documented that his bodies were donated voluntarily to his organization .
However , his largest competitor , Premier Entertainment , does n't have a well-established donation system .
Premier maintains that its cadavers are unclaimed bodies from mainland China .
And therein lies the concern .
Activists and journalists believe 'unclaimed bodies ' is a euphemism for 'executed political prisoners. '

The fear is n't unfounded .
In 2006 , Canada commissioned a human rights report that found Chinese political prisoners were being killed so that their organs could be 'donated ' to transplant patients .
And in February 2008 , ABC News ran an expose featuring a former employee from one of the Chinese companies that supplied corpses to Premier Entertainment .
In the interview , he claimed that one-third of the bodies he processed were political prisoners .
Not surprisingly , governments have started to take notice .
In January 2008 , the California State Assembly passed legislation requiring body exhibits to prove that all their corpses were willfully donated .

Fuel a city

Cremating a body uses up a lot of energy -- and a lot of nonrenewable resources .
So how do you give Grandma the send-off she wanted and protect the planet at the same time ?
Multitask .

Some European crematoriums have figured out a way to replace conventional boilers by harnessing the heat produced in their fires , which can reach temperatures in excess of 1,832 degrees Fahrenheit .
In fact , starting in 1997 , the Swedish city of Helsingborg used local crematoriums to supply 10 percent of the heat for its homes .

Get sold , chop shop-style

Selling a stiff has always been a profitable venture .
In the Middle Ages , grave robbers scoured cemeteries and sold whatever they could dig up to doctors and scientists .
And while the business of selling cadavers and body parts in the United States is certainly cleaner now , it 's no less dubious .

Today , the system runs like this : Willed-body donation programs , often run by universities , match cadavers with the researchers who need them .
But because dead bodies and body parts ca n't be sold legally , the middlemen who supply these bodies charge large fees for 'shipping and handling. '

Shipping a full cadaver can bring in as much as $ 1,000 , but if you divvy up a body into its component parts , you can make a fortune .
A head can cost as much as $ 500 ; a knee , $ 650 ; and a disembodied torso , $ 5,000 .

The truth is , there are never enough of these willed bodies to meet demand .
And with that kind of money on the mortician 's table , corruption abounds .

In the past few years , coroners have been busted stealing corneas , crematorium technicians have been caught lifting heads off bodies before they 're burned , and university employees at body donation programs have been found stealing cadavers .

After UCLA 's willed-body program director was arrested for selling body parts in 2004 , the State of California recommended outfitting corpses with bar code tattoos or tracking chips , like the kinds injected into dogs and cats .
The hope is to make cadavers easier to inventory and track down when they disappear .

Become a Soviet tourist attraction

Russian revolutionary Vladimir Lenin wanted to be buried in his family plot .
But when Lenin died in 1924 , Joseph Stalin insisted on putting his corpse on public display in Red Square , creating a secular , Communist relic .

Consequently , an organization called the Research Institute for Biological Structures was formed to keep Lenin 's body from decay .
The Institute was no joke , as some of the Soviet Union 's most brilliant minds spent more than 25 years working and living on site to perfect the Soviet system of corpse preservation .
Scientists today still use their method , which involves a carefully controlled climate , a twice-weekly regimen of dusting and lubrication , and semi-annual dips in a secret blend of 11 herbs and chemicals .

Unlike bodies , however , fame ca n't last forever .
The popularity of the tomb is dwindling , and the Russian government is now considering giving Lenin the burial he always wanted .

Snuggle up with your stalker

When a beautiful young woman named Elena Hoyos died of tuberculosis in Florida in 1931 , her life as a misused object of desire began .
Her admirer , a local X-ray technician who called himself Count Carl von Cosel , paid for Hoyos to be embalmed and buried in a mausoleum above ground .

Then , in 1933 , the crafty Count stole Elena 's body and hid it in his home .
During the next seven years , he worked to preserve her corpse , replacing her flesh as it decayed with hanger wires , molded wax , and plaster of Paris .
He even slept beside Elena 's body in bed -- that is , until her family discovered her there .

In the ensuing media circus , more than 6,000 people filed through the funeral home to view Elena before she was put to rest .
Her family buried her in an unmarked grave so that von Cosel could n't find her , but that did n't stop his obsession .
Von Cosel wrote about Elena for pulp fiction magazines and sold postcards of her likeness until he was found dead in his home in 1952 .
Near his body was a life-size wax dummy made to look just like Elena .

Do n't spread an epidemic

In the aftermath of natural disasters such as tsunamis , floods and hurricanes , it 's common for the bodies of victims to be buried or burned en masse as soon as possible .
Supposedly , this prevents the spread of disease .

But according to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , dead bodies have been getting a bad rap .
It turns out that the victims of natural disasters are no more likely to harbor infectious diseases than the general population .
Plus , most pathogens ca n't survive long in a corpse .

Taken together , the WHO says there 's no way that cadavers are to blame for post-disaster outbreaks .
So what is ?
The fault seems to lie with the living or , more specifically , their living conditions .
After a disaster , people often end up in crowded refugee camps with poor sanitation .
For epidemic diseases , that 's akin to an all-you-can-eat buffet .

Stand trial

In 897 , Pope Stephen VI accused former Pope Formosus of perjury and violation of church canon .
The problem was that Pope Formosus had died nine months earlier .

Stephen worked around this little detail by exhuming the dead pope 's body , dressing it in full papal regalia , and putting it on trial .
He then proceeded to serve as chief prosecutor as he angrily cross-examined the corpse .
The spectacle was about as ludicrous as you 'd imagine .

In fact , Pope Stephen appeared so thoroughly insane that a group of concerned citizens launched a successful assassination plot against him .
The next year , one of Pope Stephen 's successors reversed Formosus ' conviction , ordering his body reburied with full honors .

Stave off freezer burn

At cryonics facilities around the globe , the dead are n't frozen anymore .
The reason ?
Freezer burn .
As with steaks and green beans , freezing a human body damages tissues , largely because cells burst as the water in them solidifies and expands .
In the early days of cryonics , the theory was that future medical technology would be able to fix this damage , along with curing whatever illness killed the patient in the first place .

Realizing that straight freezing is n't the best option , today 's scientists have made significant advances in cryonics .
Using a process called vitrification , the water in the body is now replaced with an anti-freezing agent .
The body is then stored at cold temperatures , but no ice forms .

In 2005 , researchers vitrified a rabbit kidney and successfully brought it back to complete functionality -- a big step in cryonics research .
( It may help in organ transplants someday , too .

But science has yet to prove that an entire body can be revived .
Even worse , some vitrified bodies have developed large cracks in places where cracks do n't belong .
Until those kinks get worked out , the hope of being revived in the future will remain a dream .
