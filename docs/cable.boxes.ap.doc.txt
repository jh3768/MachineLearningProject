Cable set-top boxes may be on the way out - CNN.com
WASHINGTON ( AP ) -- The set-top box , a necessary appendage for millions of cable television customers for decades , is moving toward extinction .

A leading television manufacturer , Sony Electronics Inc. , and the National Cable and Telecommunications Association said Tuesday they signed an agreement that will allow viewers to rid themselves of set-top boxes , yet still receive advanced 'two-way ' cable services , such as pay-per-view movies .

In most cases , cable viewers also could dispose of another remote control since they could use their TV 's control rather than one tied to the set-top box .

The agreement marks a significant meeting of the minds between cable companies and one of the world 's dominant makers of consumer electronics .

The two industries have been feuding for a decade about how best to deliver cable service to customers while allowing them to buy equipment of their own choosing .

Sony agreed to use the cable industry 's technology in its sets as soon as possible but could not say when the first such televisions might be appear in stores .

The agreement is between Sony and the nation 's six largest cable companies : Comcast Corp. , Time Warner Cable Inc. , Cox Communications Inc. , Charter Communications Inc. , Cablevision Systems Corp. and Bright House Networks .
The six companies serve more than 82 percent of cable subscribers .

Cable subscribers are generally locked into renting a set-top box from their provider if they want more than the most basic cable TV service .

More than a decade ago , Congress ordered the cable industry to allow outside electronics makers to compete for the boxes .
The industry responded by developing the 'cable card .
' The cards are inserted into competing boxes , televisions or other devices and unscramble the cable signal .

The cards have been the source of frequent customer complaints and never proved popular .
In addition , sets can only receive signals from their cable company , not vice versa .
Subscribers were unable to enjoy 'two-way ' features such as video on demand , on-screen channel guides and cable company-provided digital video recorders .

Customers will still be able to attach their own devices -- like TiVo digital video recorders , according to the NCTA .

Under the new system , customers will still need to get a cable card from their provider , but the agreement means , hopefully , technical glitches will be eliminated , 'two-way ' services will be available and there will be no need for the clunky boxes .

The cable association said it was hopeful other electronics manufacturers will also agree to use the same technology .

The industry hopes to head off action by the Federal Communications Commission to impose a two-way standard on the industry .

' Every member of the FCC has encouraged the parties to resolve these highly technical issues in private-sector negotiations, ' said Kyle McSlarrow , president of NCTA .
Tuesday 's announcement means they have done so , he added .

The FCC declined to comment on the agreement Tuesday .
