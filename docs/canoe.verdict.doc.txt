'Canoe Man' and wife jailed for fraud - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- A husband and wife who faked the man 's drowning death in a $ 500,000 fraud have each been sentenced to more than six years in jail , according to reports .

A judge at Teesside Crown Court sentenced 56-year-old Anne Darwin to six and a half years Wednesday , the Associated Press reported .
She was found guilty earlier in the day of six counts of fraud and nine counts of money laundering .

Her 57-year-old husband John , who had pleaded guilty , received six years and three months .

Anne Darwin had claimed her husband had forced her to go through with the plan in order to con insurance and pension companies by faking his death at sea in a canoeing accident .

However , the jury rejected her defense and she was convicted on each of the 15 counts at the end of a seven day trial .

Her husband John , a former prison officer and teacher , shocked police when he appeared at a police station in central London in late 2007 -- five years after he was thought to have drowned off the coast of north-east England .

A coroner declared John Darwin dead in 2003 , 13 months after his disappearance .

According to the British Press Association , prosecuting lawyer Andrew Robertson said that the couple conspired to commit the fraud through 'shame and embarrassment ' at possible bankruptcy over mortgage repayments on a dozen properties .

The court heard how Anne Darwin put forward an initial defense of 'marital coercion, ' claiming her husband forced her to go along with his plan .

However Robertson told the jury that when Darwin walked into a police station last December , claiming to be suffering from amnesia , his wife was living in Panama with assets of almost $ 1million , PA reported .

Anne Darwin showed no reaction as the jury foreman delivered the verdicts after four hours of deliberation , according to PA. Her sons -- Mark and Anthony -- sat in the public gallery as the verdicts were read out in a silent courtroom .
Neither of the sons reacted to the guilty verdicts .
