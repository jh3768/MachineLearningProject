Hong Kong Cyberport refocuses on digital community - CNN.com
HONG KONG , China ( CNN ) -- Cyberport officially launched in 2004 as Hong Kong 's $ 2 billion IT flagship with the mission to become a leading information technology hub of the Asia-Pacific region .

It won the Intelligent Building of the Year Award 2004 and 2005 , and has since developed into a 24-hectare site hosting close to 100 IT companies and two university programs in four office buildings , one five-star hotel , a retail arcade and a deluxe residential development .

Four years on , what has become of Cyberport 's silicon promise ?

Veteran IT reporter Jimo 's first impression of Cyberport when she visited last year was : 'Property .
Cyberport was not surrounded by labs or fabs , just apartments. '

And yet , visionary founder and financier Richard Li himself has publicly insisted from the very beginning that Cyberport is 'not , I repeat , not , property development. '

Jimo resumes Silicon-Valley comparisons in terms of 'culture ' : 'Hong Kong people are usually best at the financial sector and service industries, ' she says .
' Those from the U.S. are usually more innovative in technology , including marketing and long-term business development of IT .
Hong Kong companies seem to focus on short-term goals without much consideration for long-term concepts , which is where real innovation lies. '

Nicholas Yang , CEO of Cyberport since October 2003 and well-aware of his 'inherited negative legacy, ' seeks to re-manage expectations : 'We do n't do R&amp ; D here .
Period. That 's a job for a high-tech science park .
Our goal is purely on community and commercialization .
The true link between technology people and businesses .
That 's what we want to focus on. '

Staying out of the red

The Cyberport Project is the commercial enterprise of Hong Kong Cyberport Management Company Limited , which is a private limited company wholly owned by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government .

As such , Yang is responsible for overseeing the development , management and marketing of Cyberport , as well as for formulating viable strategies to keep the venture out of the red .
It has not been an easy task .

He cites among the main reasons for its previous financial losses the popping of the Internet bubble in 2000 , followed by the exorbitant cost of early investments in high-end infrastructure and then-budding technologies such as open wifi .

Today , Yang says maintaining Cyberport 's state-of-the-art infrastructure costs over $ 2.5 million every year .
The good news is , at least now he can afford it .

But even more significant to Cyberport 's teetering status was the SARS epidemic that hit Hong Kong at its heart in 2003 , when 1,200 out of the 2,800 residential units expected to sustain the project were sold well below cost .

A cozy place for startups

While these past financial deficits have delayed development , Cyberport has since caught up with its renters and proudly boasts its own initiatives .

Events such as the annual Digital Entertainment Leadership Forum ( '3D Cinema ' is the theme on April 8 , 2008 ) and Cyberport Venture Capital Forum ( December ) offer precious international business matching opportunities and insight .

Cyberport 's four 'facilitating platforms ' ( Digital Media Center , Wireless Development Centrex , iResource Center , IncuTrain Center ) aim to provide tenants and visitors with the tools to further understand or explore developing new technologies .

While the highly popular Digital Media Center may be the most spectacular with its high-end equipment for virtual shooting , editing and post-production of digital cinema , it 's the IncuTrain Center that truly testifies to Cyberport 's 'strategic clustering of companies. '

Of the program 's 42 'incubatees, ' 30 are on-site in Cyberport 3 , all benefiting from support including free rent , highly subsidized training , equipment rental , marketing and legal fees , potential mentorship , international business matching and exchange programs , in addition to the obvious networking environment that comes with the strategically clustered location .

The only catch is , the incubation expires after two years .
And as startups go , the market turnover rate already hovers around 80 percent .

In this context , 2-year-old Frenzoo , a social networking company developing 3D fashion and lifestyle avatars , is a model student .

From a three-person startup working out of a storefront in Sheung Wan -- an area close to the busy center of Hong Kong -- the company was successfully admitted to the IncuTrain program in Spring 2006 , participated in a Cyberport-sponsored visit to Malaysia , won a Singaporean competition for best 2.0 company in 2007 , recruited feedback 'ambassadors ' in mainland China and has since found a new investor in Skype .

Needless to say , the soon-to-graduate incubatee is now ready to leave the nest .
The IncuTrain program was 'perfect as an initial ramp, ' confirms Frenzoo co-founder and CEO Simon Newstead .
' Now we 're ready to succeed on our own. '

Cyberport 4 is reserved for Hong Kong University 's Cyberport Institute , directly supported by local industry partners Cisco Systems ( HK ) , Hewlett Packard ( HK ) , IBM ( China/HK ) , Microsoft ( HK ) and Oracle ( HK ) , which provides digital media training , along with Polytechnic University 's MIRACLE program .

IncuTrain Center companies also benefit from the possible recruitment of on-site graduates , with respectively subsidized internship training and staffing .

CEO Yang says that Cyberport 's focus over the next three to five years will be on digital lifestyle , 'creating new business opportunities and new ways of working, ' hence cultivating the high-tech community .

Four years on , Cyberport 's promotional digital acronym MEGA still stands for premium content in media , entertainment , games , advertising .
' It 's whatever flows in that broadband pipe that 's meaningful, ' Yang reiterates .

A place for enterprise , but not a place to live ?

Meanwhile on the pedestrian side of the plumbing , some tenants are still grumbling .

' Cyberport is quite picturesque , with lots of space and outdoor areas ; however , the general lack of infrastructure within and around the location makes it frustrating and unattractive, ' remarks one particularly disgruntled employee , who has been commuting to Cyberport from the Kowloon side for the past two years .

' There is only one ATM for HSBC, ' she continues , 'which is not fully operational , with no capabilities to deposit a check and often no cash .
Everything costs more here , from lunch , to transport .
In addition , general services , such as a doctor , are simply not available , and if they are , quite expensive. '

Indeed , many of the more established companies situated in Cyberport offer their employees incentives such as additional financial compensation ( up to 20 percent compared to the same position in a more central location ) , free shuttle buses ( OMD , FedEx , Microsoft ) to the subway or to nearby town Aberdeen , and longer lunch hours .

As for community , Cyberport continues to host informal family events such as Lunchtime Music Appreciation , outdoor movies and market days .

But outside the buzzing IncuTrain Center , it seems that 'the majority of companies keep to themselves, ' says Disgruntled Employee .

She adds , 'It 's quite ironic that although Cyberport is supposed to be strong on IT infrastructure , many of our overseas associates have suggested that it would be more appropriate to change its name to 'analogue port, ' given the number of technical problems we experience. '

To which Yang 's observation still resonates : 'Anywhere else outside of Hong Kong , where do the high-tech parks spring up ?
I guarantee you , it 's out in the boondocks... Why is Hong Kong so different ?
The convenience blinded us. '

Always passionate about his job and devoted to his cause , Cyberport 's CEO concludes : 'We are trying to demonstrate a point on an intelligent community .
That 's our goal -- we 're not there yet .
But that does n't make us a bad idea , or bad example , or even so , a bad community... The first person who came up with the idea might not be the best person to execute it , but they certainly had a great concept... I think it will prove itself. '
