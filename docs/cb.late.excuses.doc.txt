10 best excuses for coming to work late - CNN.com
Some people wake up each morning before the alarm rings , glad to see the glowing sun and excited to start the day .

They arrive to work whistling and are hard at work before most people even arrive .
These rare creatures , also known as 'morning people, ' are incomprehensible to those of you whose morning routines are exercises in panic and frustration .

A lot more people belong in that latter group than you might have guessed .
Fifteen percent of workers admit to arriving late at least once a week , according to a recent CareerBuilder.com survey .

Why are so many of us running late ?

You might be surprised that the snooze button is not the primary culprit of tardiness .

Thirty-two percent of workers attribute their late arrivals to traffic gridlock .
Seventeen percent claim a lack of sleep is the reason , and 7 percent have trouble arriving on time because they need to get their children ready for school or day care .

Other issues , like forgetting something at home or not feeling well , are also popular .

Fortunately for late arrivers , 43 percent of hiring managers wo n't count tardiness against you as long as you meet deadlines and turn in good work .

Of course , some managers feel differently and will hand you a pink slip if you 're late several times within a year .

Use your imagination

More than 27 percent of hiring managers say they are skeptical of employees ' excuses for showing up late .
It turns out their doubt is warranted : 24 percent of all employees decide to make up a fake excuse rather than tell the truth .

What does this mean to you ?

If you 're sitting in a traffic jam watching the minutes tick away and you 've decided honesty is n't the best policy for you , think of a believable and acceptable reason you 're walking in late .

After all , if you were a hiring manager who heard any of these 10 real-life excuses for being late , you 'd be suspicious , too .

While rowing across the river to work , I got lost in the fog .

Someone stole all my daffodils .

I had to go audition for American Idol .

My ex-husband stole my car so I could n't drive to work .

My route to work was shut down by a Presidential motorcade .

I have transient amnesia and could n't remember my job .

I was indicted for securities fraud this morning .

The line was too long at Starbucks .

I was trying to get my gun back from the police .

I did n't have money for gas because all of the pawn shops were closed .

Be a crowd-pleaser

When it comes to punctuality , your best bet is to take cues from your company 's culture .
If everyone is diligently working when you drag yourself through the door each morning , then you probably stand out .

However , if everyone filters in at their own pace between 8 : 45 and 9 : 15 , then an occasional late arrival will probably go unnoticed .

Habitual lateness , on the other hand , will help neither your career prospects nor your workplace relationships .
For one thing , your boss and co-workers are relying on you to be at work when you 're scheduled to arrive ; you do n't want to disappoint them .

Also , just because nobody confronts you about your tardiness , that does n't mean no one 's watching the clock and forming an opinion about you or your work ethic .

These judgments can damage you when it comes to performance reviews and promotions .
Do n't let a few extra minutes of sleep cost you your reputation -- or worse , your job .
