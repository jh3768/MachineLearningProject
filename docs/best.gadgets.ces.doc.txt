New year, new toys: eight highlights from CES - CNN.com
LAS VEGAS , Nevada ( CNN ) -- Every year , the International Consumer Electronics Show yields dozens of exciting , useful and just plain silly high-tech gadgets .
Sometimes they 're even useful and silly at the same time , like a wristwatch cell phone .

Some products are in stores now , although many are due later this year and a few are still in the prototype stage .
Which , if any , will catch on with consumers ?
It 's probably too soon to tell .

CNN spent several days touring the booths at CES , which ended Sunday .
Here are a handful of gadgets that caught our eye :

LG Touch Watch Phone

LG Electronics made a splash in Vegas when it unveiled what it claims is the world 's first market-ready touch-screen watch phone .
That 's right , a phone you wear on your wrist .

' You want to think James Bond , 'Get Smart, ' Dick Tracy .
It 's all that and more, ' LG spokesman Martin Valdez said .
' You 'll never have to worry about losing your phone anymore. '

The tiny , 3G-capable gadget has a 1.4-inch screen but packs a host of features such as Bluetooth , text messaging , still and video camera and a built-in speaker for playing music files .

LG has n't decided on a wireless carrier or set a price for the watch phone , which it hopes to begin selling in Europe and the U.S. this year .
But wo n't people feel silly talking into their wrists ?

iRiver Wave-Home networking device

This minimalist , A-frame-shaped gadget wants to be your alarm clock , stereo , laptop , video-conferencing phone and digital photo frame all at once .
The Wave-Home features a 7-inch touch screen , webcam , built-in speakers , Internet access , MP3 music and video player , SD slot , USB port and more .

iRiver , a Korean-based company , hopes to get the device on the American market by the end of the year at a price -- probably under $ 400 -- that it hopes will encourage consumers to buy several units for many rooms of their home .

Sony Vaio Lifestyle PC

Smaller than a netbook and larger than a smart phone , this sleek device combines the best features of both .
For one , it weighs 1.4 pounds and is small enough to fit in your coat pocket .

' It has a cool factor, ' Sony product manager Xavier Lauwaert said .
' You go to a Starbucks and pop this out of your jacket , and people will go , 'Ooh !

This Vaio has built-in Bluetooth and GPS technology and runs on Verizon 's 3G network , so it 's connected to the Web anywhere you can get a cell-phone signal .
It also features an 8-inch screen , webcam , two USB ports and a promised four hours of battery life .

The device is available in five colors and hits stores next month .
A 60 GB model will sell for $ 900 , a 128 GB model for $ 1,500 .

Motorola Aura cell phone

This $ 1,999 luxury accessory does n't have the Web-browsing ability of a smart phone , but it has style to burn .
Handcrafted from stainless steel and sapphire crystal , each one takes two weeks to manufacture .
The phone opens like a switchblade on Swiss-engineered gears , and its round display screen has the look of a classic watch face .

The Aura went on sale last month and contains most basic cell-phone features , but that 's not what people will want it for .

' It 's a piece of art, ' Motorola marketing Vice President Melissa Gardner said .
' We 're targeting it around people who really value fashion and style .
' And a big bank account .

Polaroid Instant Digital Camera

If you 're mourning Polaroid 's recent decision to stop making film for its classic instant cameras , here 's some good news .
This 5-megapixel camera , due on the market in March , contains a built-in printer for producing 2-by-3-inch pictures on the go .
The camera 's printer contains no ink or toner ; the prints pass through a thermal heat head , activating dye crystals embedded in the print paper and producing an image .

The resulting pictures are a little grainy , but they 're ready in seconds and have a sticky-back feature for scrapbooking .
And , unlike your old Polaroid , you can review the image on the camera 's LCD screen before deciding whether to print it .

' It 's not going to replace your 12-megapixel camera, ' Polaroid marketing associate Michael Holmes said .
' It 's fun .
It 's convenient. '

The camera will retail for $ 199 , and a 10-pack of print paper will cost about $ 5 .

Livescribe Pulse smart pen

A finalist in a 'Last Gadget Standing ' competition at CES on Saturday , this writing implement is a pen and a computer in one .
Thanks to an infrared camera near the pen 's tip and special paper with microdots that track the pen 's movement , the Pulse can digitally capture handwritten notes .

A digital recorder links the notes to audio recorded at the same time -- a lecture , for example -- while handwriting-recognition software allows users to tap anywhere in their written notes and bring up the audio that was recorded when those words were jotted down .
The pen contains a USB dock that allows users to upload their notes to a laptop .

The Pulse is available in a 1 GB model for $ 149 .
A 2 GB model , which supposedly can record up to 60,000 pages of notes , is $ 199 .

The Sharper Image 's MP3 player keychain

OK , so maybe the keychain part is n't that exciting .
But this affordable little MP3 player aims to please with digital photo and video capability , two sets of earbuds and two headset jacks for sharing music with your loved one .
Best of all , it 'll play its music wirelessly through your car 's stereo .

The device comes in many colors and is expected to hit stores in April or May for $ 59.99 .

Jensen JCR-290 alarm clock

This bedside alarm clock looks ordinary enough , but it 's got an unusual feature : It listens to you .
Voice-recognition software lets users program the clock through simple verbal commands instead of pushing multiple buttons , which will be popular with the elderly or the technologically challenged .

' It 's easy for just about anyone to set the alarm without pulling out the owner 's manual, ' said Ron Shulda , design and product manager for Spectra , the clock 's manufacturer .
Shulda expects the clock to hit the market in the spring and retail for $ 29.99 .
