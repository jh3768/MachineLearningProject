Colombia extradites 14 drug suspects to U.S. - CNN.com
BOGOTA , Colombia ( CNN ) -- The Colombian government sent 14 suspected paramilitary leaders to the United States on drug charges Tuesday after authorities said they violated a 2003 deal with the government .

' This morning , a group of citizens were extradited, ' President Alvaro Uribe said in a nationally televised address Tuesday .
' Some of them had relapsed into their crimes ... others were n't cooperating with justice , and all had failed to compensate their victims. '

Authorities say the men were members of the outlawed United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia , or AUC , an organization that the United States regards as one of the most powerful drug trafficking rings in the world and has labeled a terrorist organization .

The men boarded a plane around 6 : 45 a.m. to face charges in Washington , Florida , New York and Texas .

The defendants , who authorities say held various positions of power in the drug ring , will face charges including conspiracy to import and manufacture cocaine , providing support to a terrorist organization and money laundering .

Under the terms of the original deal , Uribe said the Colombian government agreed to freeze extradition to the United States and grant the defendants light sentences if they confessed to their crimes and compensated their victims .

Uribe said he agreed to extradition because authorities believed the men were dealing drugs from inside prison .

In exchange for their extradition to the United States , the Department of Justice agreed not to seek life sentences .

' These extraditions are yet another substantial step by the government of Colombia , in partnership with the United States , to hold accountable those who support terrorist organizations and send illegal drugs into this country, ' said U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey in a statement from the Drug Enforcement Administration .

The 14 men , taken from three Colombian prisons , left for the United States about 6 : 45 a.m. , the Colombian government said .
A plane carrying 11 of them landed late Tuesday afternoon in Miami , Florida .
Another was flown directly to New York , while the two others were flown to Tampa , Florida .

The DEA said they would make initial court appearances in the districts where they arrived in the United States .

The defendants include Salvatore Mancuso Gomez , called 'El Mono, ' once allegedly among the group 's most senior leadership .
Some of the defendants have already been indicted in the United States , including Diego Fernando Murillo Bejarano , for allegedly conspiring to smuggle thousands of kilograms of cocaine into the U.S .

Last week , Colombia extradited paramilitary boss Carlos Mario Jimenez Naranjo , also believed to be a former AUC leader , on drug-trafficking charges in the United States .
Colombia claimed Jimenez had continued to traffic in drugs while in prison .
His lawyer entered a not guilty plea on his behalf .

The AUC was formed as an umbrella organization for militias battling left-wing guerilla groups Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) and the National Liberation Army ( ELN ) .
Both FARC and ELN are at war with the Colombian government .

Under the guise of protecting the Colombian public from these leftist rebel groups , the AUC committed numerous human rights abuses , according to the U.S. State Department and Human Rights Watch .

The abuses include 'the massacre of hundreds of civilians , the forced displacement of entire villages and the kidnapping of political figures to force recognition of AUC demands, ' then-U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell said in 2001 , when he designated the group a terrorist organization .
The U.S. also considers FARC and ELN terrorist organizations .

Dozens of current and former Colombian lawmakers have been linked to the AUC .
Many others , including Uribe 's second cousin , ex-Sen. Mario Uribe Escobar , are under investigation for alleged ties .
