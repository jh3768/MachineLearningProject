Anglicans seek to prevent church split - CNN.com
CANTERBURY , England ( AP ) -- The world 's Anglican bishops turned Saturday to the enormous task at the heart of their once-a-decade summit : trying to keep the Anglican family from breaking apart over the Bible and homosexuality .

With its private prayer phase over , the Lambeth Conference gets down to business but is hobbled by a boycott : about one-quarter of the invited bishops -- mostly theological conservatives from Africa -- are not attending .

The 650 bishops who are here include a mix of traditionalists , moderates and liberals , all with divergent ideas about what Anglicans should believe and how their fellowship should operate .

The conference 's opening public worship is set for Sunday in Canterbury Cathedral .
The Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams , the Anglican spiritual leader , has led a three-day closed-door session this week focused on the role of the bishops as seen through the Gospel .

Williams designed the entire gathering without any votes or resolutions .
Instead , starting Monday , the bishops will hold daily Bible study and small group discussions .
They plan to release their collective 'reflections ' on the meeting when it ends Aug. 3 .

Some critics have said the program is an attempt to avoid decisive action .
The 77 million-member Anglican Communion has been splintering since 2003 , when the Episcopal Church , the U.S. Anglican body , consecrated the first openly gay bishop , V. Gene Robinson of New Hampshire .

Last month , Anglican conservatives -- frustrated that Williams has n't done more to keep the U.S. church and other liberal Anglicans in line with traditional Bible teaching -- formed a new global church network that circumvents Williams ' authority but stops short of schism .

A few leaders of that movement are attending Lambeth , but most have stayed away .
They released a statement ahead of the Sunday service condemning 'false teaching which justifies sin in the name of Christianity. '

' These are not merely matters of different perspectives and emphases, ' they wrote .
' They have led to unbiblical practice in faith and morals , resulting in impaired and broken communion .
We long for all orthodox Anglicans to join in resisting this development. '

Archbishop Phillip Aspinall , head of the Anglican Church of Australia , defended the conference design Saturday as 'not backing away from the hard realities we have to face , but nurturing the right spirit ' to confront them .

Williams has told bishops they must 'call everyone together ' instead of aligning with one group or another .
He also said bishops must not only listen to the people they lead , but also consider what God wants of them , according to bishops who discussed details of the private talks .

In one session , Williams asked the bishops , seated in the nave of the historic cathedral , to go pray with another bishop who they feel nervous about meeting , according to U.S. Episcopal Bishop George Councell of New Jersey .

Several bishops said as they looked around the cathedral , they were struck by the tombstones of Anglican church leaders who had served hundreds of years ago .
It was a good reminder not only of the history of the Anglican fellowship but also of its ability to survive turmoil .

' We 've been at this a long time, ' Councell said .

The Anglican Communion is a global fellowship of churches that trace their roots to the missionary work of the Church of England .
It is the third-largest group of churches in the world , behind Roman Catholics and Orthodox Christians .

The communion has long held together different views of ritual and Scripture .
But it 's biggest and fastest-growing churches are now in Africa and other developing regions where strict interpretation of the Bible is the norm .

The wealthy but much smaller liberal-leaning churches in the U.S. , Canada and Western Europe have seen dramatic drops in membership .

Williams barred Robinson and a few other problematic bishops from the Lambeth Conference to ensure broader participation .
But he invited U.S. leaders who consecrated Robinson and bishops from other Anglican provinces that accept gay relationships .

Robinson has traveled to Canterbury anyway , hoping to meet with as many overseas Anglican bishops as possible .
Advocates for gay and lesbian Anglicans have also set up in Canterbury , planning an opening service of their own in another church on Sunday .
