U.S. airlines report fewer delays in May - CNN.com
NEW YORK ( AP ) -- Domestic airlines improved their on-time arrival rates in May , although more than one in five flights still failed to get passengers to their destination as scheduled , according to government data released Monday .

A total of 21 percent of commercial flights in the U.S. arrived at least 15 minutes late , were canceled or diverted in May , according to the Transportation Department 's Bureau of Transportation Statistics .

That is down from more than 22 percent of late flights in the same month last year and in April of this year .
The previous month 's figure was higher in part because AMR Corp. 's American , the nation 's largest carrier , was forced to ground thousands of flights amid tighter government scrutiny of maintenance issues .

The latest government figures show American again had the most delays , getting passengers to their destinations as scheduled only 67.3 percent of the time .
It was followed by UAL Corp. 's United Airlines , the second-largest carrier , which reported 72.4 percent of on-time arrivals , and Continental Airlines Inc. , with 75.4 percent .

Weather was by far the biggest cause of late flights in May , accounting for just over 44 percent of all delays .
Only about 39 percent of flights were late because of weather a year earlier .

U.S. carriers also improved their baggage handling in May .
About 4.6 passengers out of every 1,000 reported a mishandled bag during the month , compared with nearly 6 per 1,000 a year earlier and 5 per 1,000 in April .

Reported passenger complaints fell to 885 , compared with 930 a year earlier and 1,113 in April .

The U.S. airline industry is straining under record-high fuel prices , which have prompted many carriers to raise fares , announce sweeping flight cutbacks and begin charging for amenities such as checked bags and extra legroom .

Oil prices fell sharply Monday but nonetheless remain within range of last week 's all-time highs .
Light , sweet crude for August delivery fell $ 4.54 to $ 140.75 by midday on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
