Waiting for the doctor... and waiting and waiting - CNN.com
To kill time in the obstetrician 's waiting room , Lora Jacobsen and her husband , Dustin , discuss names for their future child .
Then they read old parenting magazines left in the waiting room .
As the minutes tick by -- 30 then 45 then more than 60 -- they play games and check e-mail on their cell phones .

' One day I got so bored I took a video of myself circling around in the chair, ' says Dustin , who posted the video and blogged about his wait .

' Really , what else are you going to do ? '

His daughter Maya recently celebrated her first birthday , but Jacobsen , who lives in Leawood , Kansas , can still recall in vivid detail how maddening it was to spend so much time , month after month , waiting to see the doctor -- and he is n't the only one seething at the doctor 's office .
Others have posted videos of their long waits , like one woman who documents her three-hour wait in an exam room , and this man who declares , 'This sucks .
I hate doctors ' offices. '

Long waits are also a common complaint on our weekly Empowered Patient 'sound-offs. '

' Why has it become routine to make patients wait two to three hours to be seen ?
' asked one Empowered Patient reader .

' First , you wait in the main waiting area , then the nurse takes you into a small room , takes your vitals , and you are left in a holding pattern for another hour .
You are treated rudely if you even dare to utter a complaint. '

' Am I seriously supposed to believe that every single one of my doctors have so many 'emergencies ' during the day that they are forced to be late seeing me ?
' asked another Empowered Patient reader .
' Get real .
It 's called over-booking. '

One patient got so mad he even sued his doctor for being late -- and won $ 250 in small claims court .
By being four hours late , Aristotelis Belavilas says , his physician was giving the message that 'I 'm God and you 're not and I do whatever I want. '

It 's probably fair to say none of us ever wants to sit so long in a doctor 's waiting room that we resort to filing a lawsuit or videotaping ourselves .
But there are strategies you can use to try and prevent frustrating waits .

Stage a revolt

' I ended up waiting two hours to see my gynecologist once , and I just went nuts, ' says Joanna Lipari , who lives in Santa Monica , California .
' I 'm a New York Italian , and we do n't go well for this kind of stuff .
I was so irritated that I gathered together the other eight ladies in the room and joked , 'Let 's stage a revolt .

The other women took her seriously , and wrote letters to the doctor .
' I told her she 's a wonderful doctor , but this really was n't cool .
I told her it was inconvenient , uncomfortable and spoke badly for an otherwise exceptional medical practice, ' says Lipari .
' I was trying to change her behavior , and it worked .
They changed the way they scheduled appointments. '

Lipari , a psychologist who herself works in a large medical practice , says sometimes doctors do n't even realize how long their patients have been waiting .
She adds that her gynecologist still is late sometimes ( after all , she does deliver babies ) , but when she is , the office calls Lipari ahead of time to alert her .

A letter from you might be the wake-up call your doctor needs , Dr. L. Gordon Moore , a family practice doctor in Seattle , Washington .
' We 've seen hundreds of practices turn things around, ' says Moore , who 's on the faculty of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement , which has some of these 'improvement stories ' listed on their Web site .

Ditch your doctor

Ditch your doctor and try one on this map from the Ideal Medical Practices Project .
Moore is the director and says the physicians on this map are working towards being on time for their patients .

Unfortunately , there 's a limited number of doctors on this site , but you can always ask your friends if they have a doctor who does n't make them wait .

Do n't wait more than 15 minutes

When you 're in the waiting room , speak up sooner rather than later .
' After 15 minutes , max , ask the receptionist what 's happening and if you 've been forgotten, ' Moore says .

Be a smart scheduler

Sean Kelley has diabetes and spends more than his fair share of time in doctors ' waiting rooms .
In a recent blog for Health magazine , he offered these scheduling tips :

& # 8226 ; Book the first appointment in the morning , or the first appointment after lunch

& # 8226 ; Ask the scheduler to book you on the lightest day of the week ( Kelley says for some reason his doctor 's office is nearly empty on Wednesdays ) .

& # 8226 ; Avoid school holidays if your doctor or dentist sees kids .

For some more scheduling strategies from Lipari , read her blog .

Kelley 's pet peeve : Drug reps who waltz into the doctor 's office when he 's been waiting for two hours .
' They just wave at the receptionist and walk right in .
And you can always spot a drug rep because they 're dragging luggage behind them and they 're always cute, ' Kelley says .
' They can see the doctor whenever they want .
How 'd they get the keys to the kingdom ? '

Shut up and wait

This was the Jacobsens ' decision .
They liked their obstetrician and did n't want to switch in the middle of her pregnancy .

During my third pregnancy , I made the same decision .
I had several ridiculously long waits for my obstetrician , and learned to bring a good book and my laptop computer .

To their credit , during one three-hour-long wait , a nurse came out and apologized , explaining the doctor had run to the hospital to deliver a baby .
Not wanting to incur the wrath of a roomful of hungry pregnant women , she brought us granola bars and bottles of water .
I forgave them instantly , and went to him again for baby number four .
