Moyes discusses fresh Everton contract - CNN.com
LONDON , England ( AP ) -- Everton manager David Moyes is in talks with the club over a new contract .

Moyes has been in charge of the team since 2002 and his current contract expires at the end of the coming season .

' We 've started talks and we 're hoping things will be wrapped up quickly, ' Moyes said Tuesday .

Since arriving from Preston in 2002 , Moyes has turned Everton from relegation contenders into regular qualifiers for Europe .

In 2005 , he guided the club to fourth place in the Premier League and into the qualifying rounds of the Champions League .

Aston Villa manager Martin O'Neill could be about to sign new players in time to play them in Saturday 's Intertoto Cup match against Odense .

Players must be registered 24 hours before the match against the Danish team , suggesting that O'Neill could add to the signings of Steve Sidwell and goalkeeper Brad Guzan by Friday .

' I think that if there were players to arrive in the next couple of days , I would n't have any massive hesitation in considering them for Saturday , especially if they 've been training with their own clubs, ' O'Neill said .

' I 'd be keen to get them in , but by the same token I do n't want to go out of this competition , so I want people to be as right as they possibly can be at this stage of the season. '

Villa have made an offer for Blackburn midfielder David Bentley , who has also been linked with Tottenham .

Celtic have signed Greece striker Georgios Samaras from Manchester City on a three-year contract .

The 23-year-old Samaras has been on loan at Parkhead since January and scored five goals in 16 league matches to help Celtic win a third straight Scottish Premier League title .

The clubs did not reveal the transfer fee , but British papers had speculated that it would be $ 2.01 million .

Samaras scored 12 goals in 65 appearances for City .
