BA pilots to vote on strike action - CNN.com
LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- British Airways ' 32,000 pilots are to vote for a strike action over the airline 's plans to set up a subsidiary for services between continental Europe and the U.S .

Pilots are frustrated over the airline 's refusal to ensure there will be open access to jobs on the subsidiary service .

OpenSkies , as it has been named , will begin operations in June following the US/European Union 'open skies ' deal to liberalize transatlantic air services .

The decision to ballot was taken after weeks of fruitless negotiations between the pilots ' union British Airline Pilots ' Association ( BALPA ) and BA .
Following a three-week ballot period commencing on 29 January and a seven-day decision period for BA , the strike , if endorsed , would go ahead from 19 February .

' This is not about money ; and it is not about safety, ' said BALPA General Secretary Jim McAuslan on Monday .
The union was keen to disassociate the dispute with BA038 crash-landing last week .

He said there were fears , 'borne out by BA 's intransigence ' , that the airline 's real aim is to start an outsourcing program that will eventually force down BA pilot conditions .

' We believe there should be one pilot body for BA and its subsidiary so that there can be fair promotion opportunities , a cohesion of the pilot force which is so important in a safety critical industry and a safeguarding of BA 's brand, ' said McAuslan .

BALPA has confirmed said 78 percent of pilots are in favor of a strike .
In such a situation , it would expect an employer to back down rather than ground planes and lose billions of dollars in revenue .
But if strike action did go ahead , a BALPA spokesperson could not predict how long it would last .

This would be the first strike action for BA since 1980 .
Last January , the airline narrowly avoided a 48-hour strike by cabin crew over sickness absence , pay and staffing .
