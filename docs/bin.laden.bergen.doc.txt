Bergen: Tape shows Gaza conflict 'big deal' to bin Laden - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- Osama bin Laden 's release of an audio message denouncing Israel 's military offensive in Gaza signals the al Qaeda leader 's priorities , CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen says .

On the tape , which became public Wednesday , bin Laden calls for jihad , or holy war , against Israel in response to its military campaign aimed at stopping Hamas rocket attacks .

It 's unknown when the tape was made because the time lag between recording a bin Laden message and releasing it is usually about two weeks , said Bergen , a fellow at the New America Foundation in Washington and author of 'The Osama bin Laden I Know : An Oral History of al Qaeda 's Leader. '

Bergen answered questions about the latest message from bin Laden .

Q : When was the last time we heard from bin Laden ?

Peter Bergen : We have n't heard from him in nine months .
We were expecting to hear from him during the run-up to the presidential election , as we had four years ago in the previous presidential election , and heard nothing .

This is a long period for him not to have said anything , and one potential reason is that by our bureau in Pakistan 's count , there have been 30 Hellfire missile strikes into the tribal zones in Pakistan in the last year , whereas in 2007 there were only four .

Those Hellfire missile strikes put pressure on al Qaeda and killed a number of key leaders in the last several months .
In fact , President Bush referenced those strikes in an interview [ Tuesday ] night with Larry King -- two al Qaeda leaders killed January 1 .

The missile strikes have gone up exponentially in the last year , and clearly that 's going to put a crimp on al Qaeda 's activities .
He 's survived , but these airstrikes have clearly been highly interruptive .

Q : Why are we hearing this time from bin Laden and not his lieutenant , Ayman al-Zawahiri , who speaks out much more frequently ?

Bergen : [ Al-Zawahiri ] has been releasing more videotapes , and there 's been an occasion when [ al-Zawahiri 's ] released two tapes in one week .
Hearing from [ al-Zawahiri ] is no longer a newsworthy event .

Bin Laden has been a lot more careful .

The obvious reason for this is that with the release of a videotape or audiotape , you 're opening yourself up to detection .
Somebody 's got to tape the thing , and somebody 's got to take it to either the Al-Jazeera bureau or , more generally , a jihadi Web site .
There 's a chain of custody , and every time you do this you open yourself to exposure .

So I think they 've just made the calculation that Ayman al-Zawahiri 's going to be more talkative and that bin Laden is more important , and he 's not going to say much unless it 's sort of a big deal .
And the Israeli attacks on Gaza would certainly be a big deal for bin Laden .

If we had n't heard from him at all in all of this , I think it would have been very puzzling .

Q : Does the timing of the message seem to be affected by the impending inauguration of Barack Obama as president ?

Bergen : I think it 's affected by the Gaza issue .
The Israeli-Palestinian issue is something bin Laden has been pretty vocal about for more than a decade .
It 's nothing specifically to do with the inauguration .

I 'm pretty sure he does n't care whether it 's President Obama or President Bush .
In the early '90s , they were using a picture of President Clinton for target practice .

There 's going to be no substantially different Obama administration policy on most of the issues bin Laden cares about .
I mean , he wants the destruction of the state of Israel .
Obviously the Obama administration is not going to advocate that .

Q : Is bin Laden still relevant ?
Do people still listen and respond to him ?

Bergen : I think if he were irrelevant , we would n't be doing the coverage .

He 's less relevant than he might have been a few years ago because a lot of Muslims have turned against al Qaeda because of its tactics and suicide operations .
But there are clearly people who still think he 's important .

He can put out general messages , you know , inciting people to violence , and this is the way it happens .
So he puts out the strategic guidance to al Qaeda , through the jihadi network , through the audio and videotapes .

Sometimes he makes specific calls for attacks on particular places .
For instance , he called for attacks on Spain , and there were attacks in Madrid in 2004 .
He called for a response to the Danish cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed , and there was an attack by al Qaeda on the Danish Embassy in Pakistan last year .
And I can give you several other examples .

That 's the way he maintains operational control .
