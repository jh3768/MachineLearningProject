Beckham's move to Milan under doubt - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- David Beckham will rejoin LA Galaxy after his bid to remain with AC Milan fell over , according to a statement on the U.S. side 's Web site .

Beckham had indicated he wanted to stay with the Italian giants -- where he is currently on loan till March 9 -- and the club had reciprocated by saying they were keen on holding on to the 33-year-old .

However , Galaxy general manager Bruce Arena said in a statement that the deal had fallen over after Milan failed to raise their offer .

' ( The ) deadline imposed by Major League Soccer commissioner Don Garber regarding a resolution of David Beckham 's potential transfer to AC Milan has passed and we did not receive an acceptable offer for the player .

' As a result , David remains an LA Galaxy player and we look forward to having him back with the club starting March 9, ' Arena said .

But later on Saturday Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti said he remained hopeful a deal could still be completed .

Speaking ahead of their derby clash with Inter Milan on Sunday , Ancelotti told Press Association that he hoped the former England captain would play in many more such matches .

' At the moment he is indispensable for Milan, ' he said .

' We still have 20 days to close the deal .
The Galaxy are trying to force the situation but there is still time until March 9. '

Beckham turned to AC Milan as he sought competitive match action to regain his place in the England squad under new coach Fabio Capello .

Beckham 's multi-million dollar move to the MLS from Real Madrid in 2007 captured global headlines , but injury and then indifferent results from his Galaxy team encouraged media reports that the former England captain would abandon the U.S. experiment .

Beckham has a five-year $ 125 million deal with Galaxy and a series of complex sponsorship arrangements .
