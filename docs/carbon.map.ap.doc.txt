Map shows top CO2 producers in the world - CNN.com
WASHINGTON ( AP ) -- There 's growing worry about global warming , but how much of it is the work of that power plant just outside town ?
And if Congress limits heat-trapping greenhouse gases , will it affect utility and electric bills ?
And who 's the biggest corporate culprit when it comes to climate change ?

Answers to these questions may be only a couple of computer clicks away .

A new interactive online database unveiled Wednesday provides maps , color-coded categories and detailed information about who is putting 10 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere annually from power plants around the world -- about a fourth of it from the United States .

The Web site , which includes information from 4,000 utilities and 50,000 plants , shows not only the biggest CO2 emitters , but also the facilities and companies that are most green , releasing little if any carbon .

' We 're trying to provide complete , balanced information .
It 's an open site, ' said David Wheeler , a senior researcher at the Center for Global Development , where he directed the creation of the massive database .

Using an array of information filters , a user can find out how much CO2 comes from electricity plants in a particular city or county , in a congressional district , from a specific company , or an individual plant .

Dubbed the Carbon Monitoring for Action database , or CARMA ( www.carma.org ) , it proclaims itself as 'the world 's best place for power-plant voyeurism. '

And there is a bundle of interesting information .

Australians produce 11 tons of CO2 for each of its people from their power plants -- the highest anywhere -- compared to 9 tons per person in the United States and 2 tons per person in China .

But the United States has the most CO2 emissions ( 2.79 billion tons ) , followed by China ( 2.66 billion tons ) .
China , which soon is expected to pass the United States , is home to three of the world 's five most CO2-polluting utilities .

China 's Huaneng Power International leads all of the world 's power companies , releasing nearly 292 million tons of CO2 annually .
That 's far more than Southern Co. and American Electric Power , the two biggest U.S. carbon emitters that each account for about 170 million tons a year , ranking sixth and seventh in the world .

Such information provides a 'a vivid illustration that rich countries and developing countries must work together to overcome the challenge of climate change, ' said Wheeler , an expert on environmental economics .

Wheeler said in an interview that the interactive database should be of interest not only to individual citizens , but also to investors , insurers and corporate executives as Congress moves closer to imposing limits on carbon emissions to address global warming .

' Never before has this kind of detailed information been made available on a global scale, ' said Nancy Birdsall , president of the Center for Global Development , a think tank that examines how rich nations interact with developing countries .

While the federal government keeps annual statistics on U.S. CO2 emissions , CARMA seeks to provide its Web site visitors more complete , worldwide data by expanding on the government 's numbers through independent research and extrapolations based on fuel use and electricity production .

The database also strives to be consumer friendly .

With a click of the computer mouse , one can see a map showing the top CO2 producers in the world and then move in closer to find information about the individual utility bringing electricity into your home .

Each emitter has a color code from green ( the cleanest ) to blue , yellow , orange and finally red ( most polluting ) .
The icons become larger the more CO2 a plant or company produces .
A large red icon shows a plant producing a lot of electricity and a lot of carbon .
A green one shows little if any carbon , often a nuclear power plant .

Click on American Electric Power , the Ohio-based utility that owns 25 coal-burning power plants , and one sees a large red icon .
It is the country 's second largest emitter of CO2 at 169,000 tons a year .
Southern Co. , based in Atlanta , releases a little more CO2 , but its code is a mix of red and orange because of its use of nuclear energy along with CO2-producing coal .
Duke Energy , 12th on the list of worldwide CO2 emitters , nevertheless gets an orange icon , also reflecting its ownership of nuclear power plants .

But of most interest to consumers may be the 'digging deeper ' option that displays CO2 emissions by plants or companies in a region , state , congressional district , town or by ZIP code .
The Ohio Valley , the Southeast and Texas rank high in CO2 emissions , reflecting heavy fossil fuel use , while the West Coast , where nuclear and hydroelectric power are in heavy use , has comparatively little CO2 pollution from power plants .

Texas power plants account for the most CO2 ( 290 million tons ) of any state , and Vermont the least ( 437,000 tons ) .
