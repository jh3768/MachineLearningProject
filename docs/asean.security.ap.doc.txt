ASEAN strongly rebukes Myanmar - CNN.com
SINGAPORE ( AP ) -- A senior figure in Myanmar 's military junta has suggested that opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi could be freed from house arrest in about six months , Singapore 's foreign minister said .

Myanmar 's Foreign Minister Nyan Win made the hint at a Sunday dinner attended by all the foreign ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations , who began their weeklong meeting in Singapore on Monday .

ASEAN later expressed 'deep disappointment ' at the junta 's decision in May to extend Suu Kyi 's detention by another year -- an unprecedented criticism of Myanmar by the region 's main bloc .
ASEAN members usually adhere to a policy of not interfering in each other 's domestic affairs .

Nyan Win 's comments are the most optimistic by the junta on Suu Kyi 's future , and the closest Myanmar 's military rulers have come to a definite timetable for her release , as demanded by the international community .

According to Singapore 's Foreign Minister George Yeo , Nyan Win said that under Myanmar law a political detainee can be held for a maximum of six years .

' And he told us that the six-year limit will come up in about half a year 's time, ' Yeo said .

Asked if this means Suu Kyi , a Nobel peace laureate , could be released in six months , Yeo said : 'That is not an inaccurate inference. '

Although Myanmar 's state-controlled media have said the government has the right to hold Suu Kyi for six years , it is the first time that such a senior figure has suggested the possibility of her release in an international forum .

The military regime extended Suu Kyi 's house arrest May 27 for the sixth straight year .
She has now been detained for more than 12 of the last 18 years at her home in Myanmar , also known as Burma .

After the dinner meeting , the ASEAN members issued a statement that came down heavily on Myanmar .

' The foreign ministers expressed their deep disappointment that ... Suu Kyi 's detention has been extended by the Myanmar government, ' it said , adding that the ministers repeated a call by their governments for her to be released .

The ministers also urged the junta to engage in a 'meaningful dialogue with all political groups and work toward a peaceful transition to democracy in the near future. '

ASEAN also urged the junta to give U.N. envoy Ibrahim Gambari access to senior leaders and to allow meetings with 'the widest possible range of contacts including Suu Kyi. '
