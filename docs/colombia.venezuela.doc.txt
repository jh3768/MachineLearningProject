Colombia detains Venezuelan soldier with ammunition - CNN.com
BOGOTA , Colombia ( CNN ) -- Colombia has detained a Venezuelan soldier found with thousands of rounds of ammunition of the kind favored by leftist rebels in Colombia , Venezuelan authorities admitted .

Colombia authorities recently detained Sgt .
Manuel Agudo Escalona along with several boxes of ammunition , Venezuelan Interior and Justice Minister Ramon Rodriguez Chacin told reporters Monday .

He said that Escalona was tricked and that Colombia authorities arrested him almost immediately after someone else put the ammunition in a boat in which he was traveling .

The confiscated ammunition was for AK-47 assault rifles -- of the kind used by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia , or FARC , a Marxist insurgent force that has sought to overthrow the Colombian government since 1964 .
The United States and European Union consider the FARC a terrorist organization .

Colombia has accused Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez of funneling funds to the FARC , an allegation he has denied .

On Sunday , Chavez stunned Latin America by saying the FARC should end its guerilla war and free about 750 hostages that it holds in the jungles of South America .

Escalona , another Venezuelan and two Colombians were detained just inside Colombia near the Venezuelan border .

Authorities caught them with 40,000 bullets for AK-47s that they supposedly were going to sell to the FARC , Colombian Attorney General Mario Iguaran said , according to a report carried by Caracol Radio of Colombia .

The four admitted to arms trafficking on Sunday , the report said .

Colombian President Alvaro Uribe has accused Chavez of providing at least $ 300 million to the rebels .
He cited evidence Colombia seized on a computer recovered after a March 1 military operation that killed the FARC 's second in command , known as Raul Reyes .

The killing marked the first time in 40 years that a member of FARC 's leadership council died in combat .

Another member of the leadership council was killed a week later -- by a rebel who turned himself in to authorities -- and yet another senior leader deserted and turned herself in to Colombian authorities .

In addition , FARC founder Manuel Marulanda , alias 'Tirofijo ' ( 'Sureshot ' ) , died of natural causes in March .
