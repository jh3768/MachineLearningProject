( CNN ) -- Tuesday , November 4 , 2008 , will go down as the day America opened its history book , turned the page and started a new chapter of change .

This is truly a historic night -- a moment many of us prayed for , marched for , organized for and some even died for .
This is not the end of a journey , but the turning of a major page in American history .

If the Rev .
Martin Luther King Jr. were alive , he would have cautioned us not to stop praying , not to stop marching , but to keep the dream alive .

As Sen. Barack Obama has stated so long ago , change never comes easy .
Tuesday night , the people of America told the world that they are ready for change and they will back Obama in leading the change .

Throughout his long journey , Obama built a campaign based on three factors : It was inclusive , engaging and empowering .

The key ingredients were simply Obama 's ability to build a campaign from the bottom up .
Obama called on ordinary citizens to believe that together they could turn the page .
Second , the campaign used technology to connect people where they lived .

At every event , he reached out to citizens to talk to one another and to work toward a common purpose .
It was empowering because the campaign took root across America .

Obama planted seeds of hope .
He harvested the votes of those who gave up on politics and now America can celebrate this moment .

Anything is possible again in America .
