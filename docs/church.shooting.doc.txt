Affidavit: Man admits church shooting, says liberals should die - CNN.com
KNOXVILLE , Tennessee ( CNN ) -- A man accused of fatally shooting two adults and wounding seven others at a Knoxville church told police the church 's liberal teachings prompted him to attack , according to court papers .

Jim David Adkisson told investigators all liberals should be killed and admitted he shot people Sunday morning at Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church , according to a search warrant affidavit obtained by CNN affiliate WBIR .

Also , a four-page letter police found in Adkisson 's vehicle indicated he was motivated by frustration over being unable to obtain a job , authorities said Monday .

Police said Adkisson , 58 , of Powell , Tennessee , walked into the church 's sanctuary during a children 's musical performance and fired a shotgun before being overpowered by congregants and arrested .
Adkisson -- who police said was n't a member of the church -- has been charged with one count of first-degree murder .

According to the affidavit requesting to search Adkisson 's home , the suspect told investigators liberals should be killed because they were ruining the country .
Adkisson also blamed Democrats for the country 's decline , according to the affidavit .

' He felt that the Democrats had tied his country 's hands in the war on terror and they had ruined every institution in America with the aid of major media outlets, ' the affidavit said .
' Because he could not get to the leaders of the liberal movement ... he would then target those that had voted them into office. '

Killed in the shooting were Linda Kraeger , 61 , and Greg McKendry , 60 , police said .
Witnesses said McKendry , an usher and board member at the church , tried to shield others when he was shot , according to The Associated Press .

Four of the seven surviving wounded were still in the University of Tennessee Medical Center on Monday evening .
Officials there said two patients were in critical condition and one was 'stable .
' The hospital would not release information about the fourth person .

At a news conference Monday , Knoxville Police Chief Sterling Owen IV said Adkisson left a note in his vehicle before entering the church , thinking police would kill him after the shooting began .

Owen said the letter , signed by Adkisson but not addressed to anyone , expressed hatred for gay people and what he called the liberal movement .

According to Out &amp ; About , a gay newspaper based in Nashville , Tennessee , the church was home to several gay and gay-friendly groups and recently posted a 'gays welcome ' sign 'as part of its long-range planning to conduct more outreach and welcome ' to gay men and lesbians .

The church , on its Web site , describes itself as a community that has worked for social change -- including desegregation , women 's rights and gay rights -- since the 1950s .

The case is being investigated as a hate crime , Owen said .

Owen also said the letter expressed Adkisson 's frustrations at not being able to find employment .
Authorities also discovered a letter from the state government telling Adkisson he was having his food stamps reduced or eliminated , police said .

Owen said Adkisson has resided in the Knoxville area for three or four years and his last known employment was in 2006 .
Neighbors told The Associated Press Adkisson had been a truck driver , and Owen said Adkisson has an associate 's degree in mechanical engineering .

' He did express that frustration , that the liberal movement was getting more jobs, ' Owen told reporters .
' And he felt like he was being kept out of the loop because of his age. '

Investigators found 76 shotgun shells in the church , Owen said .
Three rounds were fired from a 12-gauge shotgun that was brought into the church hidden in a guitar case , police said .

There is 'an indication he was not targeting the children, ' but that has not been conclusively determined , Owen said .

During a search of Adkisson 's home , investigators confiscated a handgun , a sawed-off shotgun barrel and books by conservative commentators , authorities said .

The shooting came eight years after Adkisson , according to divorce documents , threatened to kill his fourth wife and himself .

In a 2000 complaint filed in Tennessee 's Anderson County , his then-wife , Liza Alexander , said she was 'in fear for my life and what he might do .
' She also claimed that Adkisson 'drinks heavily every day , and becomes belligerent , and makes threats. '

' My husband , Jim David Adkisson told a friend of mine that one of his options is to blow my brains out and then blow his own brains out ( I heard him say this ) , ' Alexander wrote in her petition for a protection order , which she was granted .

The only criminal record authorities have found of Adkisson shows two instances of driving under the influence -- one in California 'a number of years ago ' and one 'more recently ' in Tennessee , Owen said .

Authorities have been told that Adkisson was once in the military , a member of the 101st Airborne Division , Owen said .

Lt. Col. Anne Edgecomb , an Army spokeswoman , said there is a record of a Jim David Adkisson who served beginning in 1974 .
He was released from active duty in 1977 and discharged in 1980 .
He was a helicopter repairman with the 163rd Aviation Co. at Fort Campbell , Kentucky -- part of the 101st Airborne Division .

Adkisson 's military record shows that in 1977 he was demoted from a specialist 4th class to private .
Information about why Adkisson was demoted was n't available .

Neighbors said Adkisson was quiet and kept to himself .

' He never went anywhere .
He never had anybody over .
Just , it was really quiet .
He rode a motorcycle and you know he would go out on the weekends on his motorcycle , but other than that , you never heard from him, ' Melissa Coker told WVLT-TV .

Coker told the AP that Adkisson had been a truck driver , but she did n't think he 'd been working steadily in the past six months .

' He 's just a really , really nice guy, ' Coker told the AP .

Adkisson 's landlord said she did not know him well enough to make any comments on his character but said he was a good tenant who paid his bills , according to CNN affiliate WBIR-TV .

Bail was set at $ 1 million late Sunday .

Police said people were recording videos of the children 's performance when the shooting happened , and investigators were reviewing the videos .
Information on what , if anything , the videos show of the shooting was n't immediately available .

Three of the wounded were relatives who were visiting the church for the first time Sunday .
WVLT identified the three as Joe Barnhart , 76 ; Jack Barnhart , 69 ; and Betty Barnhart , 71 , who was treated and released Sunday .

A statement released by the family Monday said : 'The entire Barnhart family would like to thank our friends and the community for their calls , visits and prayers .
... Our family members continue to recover and we ask that your prayers continue for all that have been involved in this tragic event. '
