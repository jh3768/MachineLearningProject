Blackburn sign England keeper Robinson - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- New Blackburn manager Paul Ince has made his first signing for the club , snapping up England goalkeeper Paul Robinson from Tottenham for a fee of & # 163 ; 3.5 million ( $ 7m ) on a five-year contract .

The 28-year-old Robinson will be hoping for a fresh start at Ewood Park after a remarkable fall from grace at White Hart Lane .

A series of high-profile errors saw Robinson lose his position as No.1 for both England and Tottenham , where he lost his first-team place to Czech Radek Cerny .

The summer signing of Brazilian goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes from PSV Eindhoven gave a strong indication that Robinson was not going to figure uner manager Juande Ramos -- and he has chosen to return north after starting his career with Leeds United .

The size of the transfer fee is a modest one for a player who was undisputed England number one under successive coaches before Scott Carson 's shock selection by Steve McClaren in the fateful match against Croatia last November .

With Robinson arriving , Aston Villa later completed a deal to sign Blackburn 's current goalkeeper Brad Friedel on a three-year deal .

The Premier League teams had already settled upon a transfer fee for the 37-year-old Friedel , who only extended his contract with Blackburn through to 2010 in February , but Blackburn had previously said they would only sell if another club accepted their offer for a replacement -- which has now happened .

Friedel will join another American goalkeeper , Brad Guzan , at Villa .
The 23-year-old will learn next week whether he can have the work permit he needs to play in the Premier League .

Villa agreed this month to sign Guzan from Major League Soccer 's Chivas USA , and a hearing to decide whether he can have a permit has been scheduled for August 1 .

The formality thwarted a deal in January , but Guzan has played more international football since then , improving his chances of joining the Birmingham club this time .

' We 're hoping that having come so close in January , we can get the work permit this time around, ' O'Neill said .
' All told , I think his position has improved , so fingers crossed that might help -- but who knows ? '
