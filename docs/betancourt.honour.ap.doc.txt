Betancourt thanked Sarkozy and told him she was counting on him to help free the scores of other hostages held by the FARC .

' I 'm so moved, ' she said .
' Little by little , I 'm becoming myself again. '

She added : '15 days ago , I was chained to a tree .
It seems far away now. '

' I carry them in my heart, ' she said .
