Poll: Most Chinese happy with nation's direction - CNN.com
WASHINGTON ( AP ) -- Strikingly large numbers of Chinese are happy with their nation 's direction and booming economy yet are deeply worried about rising prices , pollution and the gap between the rich and poor .

That 's according to a poll by the Pew Research Center , released Tuesday .

The survey finds that two-thirds of Chinese also give their government high marks for handling important problems .
Three of four approve of Beijing 's policy of limiting most couples to one child , though it 's more popular with well-off than lower-income people .

The findings contrast sharply with recent polling in the U.S. showing large majorities of Americans holding starkly negative views about their country 's direction , its leaders in the White House and Congress , and economic conditions .
