Endeavour astronauts complete third spacewalk - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- Astronauts from the shuttle Endeavour completed their third spacewalk Saturday after nearly seven hours working on a joint that helps generate power for the international space station .

Heidemarie Stefanyshyn-Piper and Steve Bowen cleaned and lubricated the starboard Solar Alpha Rotary Joint , which is designed to allow the solar panels on the left side of the station to rotate and track the sun .

' We stayed at a very steady , even pace and got everything done we 'd planned, ' John Ray , lead spacewalk officer , said at a news conference at Johnson Space Center in Texas on Saturday .

The astronauts also removed and replaced several trundle bearing assemblies .

The spacewalkers have cleaned about 330 of 360 degrees of the starboard SARJ .
When they complete the starboard side , they will start on the port side , Ray said .

The spacewalkers wanted to continue working Saturday to finish the starboard side , Ray said , but mission controllers chose to end for the day .

The fourth and final spacewalk of the 15-day mission , which launched November 14 , is scheduled for Monday .

The SARJ has been in limited use since 2007 , when flight controllers detected increased power consumption and vibration as it moved the 240-foot solar wings to follow the sun .

Astronauts soon determined that the gear assembly was full of metal shavings , a sign that metal is grinding on metal .

Since then , cleaning and lubing the SARJ have been a major focus of this mission , along with expanding the living space to accommodate a crew of six , NASA said .

Additions to the station 's living space include more places to sleep , another bathroom , an improved water system , new exercise equipment and a bigger refrigerator .

The shuttle also brought from earth a Thanksgiving dinner of irradiated turkey , candied yams , stuffing and dessert .

Inside the station Saturday , the rest of the shuttle and station crew transferred supplies and equipment between the two spacecraft , NASA said .

The crew also continued work on the Water Recovery System and a Urine Processor Assembly , which is designed to convert urine and sweat into water , flight director Ginger Kerrick said .

The Urine Processor Assembly shut down during initial tests Thursday and Friday morning .
On Saturday , crew members were able to generate a sample from the Urine Processor Assembly , and that troubleshooting will continue Sunday , Kerrick said .

The mission has gone according to plan , despite a minor interruption on the first spacewalk .

A grease sun in Stefanyshyn-Piper tool 's bag leaked , coating everything inside with a film of lubricant .
While she was trying to clean it up in the absence of gravity , the whole bag floated away .

Stefanyshyn-Piper was able to share tools with Bowen , and NASA mission controllers expressed confidence that the lost tool bag would not be too much of a problem for the duration of the spacewalk .

Mission controllers were also tracking the lost bag , which they say is floating well clear of the station and drifting farther away .
