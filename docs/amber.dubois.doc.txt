Teen vanishes on way to school - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- Last Friday the 13th was supposed to be a special day for 14-year-old Amber Leeanne DuBois .

She left her home in Escondido , California , around 7 a.m. for school with a check in hand , a down payment on a baby lamb that she was going to raise and care for as part of her Future Farmers of America class .

It was a day that she 'd been looking forward to for more than a year , her family says .
But she never made it to school and has n't been heard from since , prompting authorities to launch a massive search for the missing teen .

' She would not have given up that lamb for anything, ' her mother , Carrie McGonigle , said .
' She 's a wholesome kid .
She does n't run amok like most teenagers .
She did not run away , I guarantee it. '

Her cell phone was turned on once for about 20 seconds the day after she disappeared and has not been turned on since then , Escondido Police spokesman Lt. Bob Benton said .

Her mother and her live-in boyfriend voluntarily submitted to polygraph tests and passed , Benton said .
Amber 's father , who lives in Orange County , California , and other relatives have been interviewed , he added .

A classmate reported seeing Amber a week ago on Sunday , walking with an unidentified person about half a mile from her home , Benton said .

' We do n't know the circumstances of her disappearance or the person she was walking with , but being 14 years old and missing as long as she has without ever having gone missing before is very suspicious, ' Benton said .

The FBI is assisting the Escondido Police in the investigation , said Special Agent Darrell Foxworth from the agency 's San Diego office .

' The assistance that we are providing includes conducting interviews and following up on leads as they develop, ' Foxworth said .

Amber 's parents insist she would never stay away from home for so long without notifying them , leading them to believe she was abducted .

' As a person who knows my daughter very , very well , I 'm 95 percent positive she 's not just wandering around the area, ' said her father , Maurice DuBois .
' If she was abducted by stranger -- hopefully not -- she could be anywhere in the U.S , Mexico by now .
Eight days is a long time to be missing. '

Amber 's parents say she was a not-so-typical teen who shunned social networking sites like MySpace.com and Facebook and preferred reading , drawing and spending time with friends at home over hanging out at the mall .

' When she 'd get in trouble , I 'd have to take her books away, ' McGonigle said , chuckling as she recalled her daughter 's habit of hiding under her bed sheets with a flashlight so she could read late at night .

Her first passion was animals , a lifelong devotion that began with her first horse , Rojo , and led to her joining the FFA when she entered high school .

Two weeks before she disappeared , she wrote her mother a letter urging her to let her buy the lamb she planned to name Nannette , outlining how she would care for it and suggesting it would look good on her resume , McGonigle said .

' I know in my heart that there 's nothing that would take her away from that lamb .
She would never miss that day .
That 's how I know she did n't just run away, ' McGonigle said .

' I go to sleep thinking she 's going to be walking in my room any minute saying , 'Mom , I 'm back .
' But now it 's just becoming a numb feeling. '

Members of the community of Escondido , a bedroom community of San Diego , have been generous with donations of money , resources and manpower in the efforts to locate Amber , her mother said .

A candlelight vigil at Escondido High School on Friday night drew about 200 people , Amber 's friend Hailey Kosinski said , in a show of support that brought a measure of comfort to her family and friends .

Hailey , who has known Amber since the sixth grade , said she could always count on her to brighten her day when she was feeling down .

' She smiles and tells you everything 's going to be OK and you just feel better, ' she said .
' She 's sort of shy when you first meet her , but once you get to know her , she 's the kindest person you 'll ever meet. '

The 14-year-old described her friend 's disappearance as a rude awakening to the dangers of ordinary life .

' It makes you think of the many , many situations that could occur when you 're walking on the street , or when you walk away from friends for just a little while, ' said Hailey , who has spent most of her free time in the past week posting fliers on traffic poles and in stores .

' It 's the most horrible , gut-wrenching feeling to know your friend is out there and there 's nothing you can do to help her .
You feel so powerless. '
