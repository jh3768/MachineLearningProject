Release of Colombian hostages set for weekend  - CNN.com
BOGOTA , Colombia ( CNN ) -- A Colombian delegation , led by a federal senator , has left for Brazil on the first leg of a multiday journey to obtain the release of six hostages held by the FARC guerrilla group .

Sen. Piedad Cordoba is heading the delegation , traveling first to San Gabriel de Cachoeira in Brazil 's Amazon jungle , where the group will coordinate the hostage release .

From there , the delegation , which also includes two journalists and members of the International Red Cross , will fly in two helicopters to the jungles of San Jose del Guaviare , Colombia .

The first of the planned three stages for the hostage release is supposed to occur Sunday , when the guerrillas have said they will set free three Colombian police officers and one soldier .
The names of those to be released is not publicly known .

The helicopters , bearing Red Cross insignia , will fly next to Villavicencio , where the freed hostages will be welcomed by members of the Colombians for Peace group , which initiated the hostage release .

On Tuesday , the senator 's delegation is scheduled to travel to another site designated by the FARC , Colombia 's oldest and largest Marxist guerrilla group .
FARC is the Spanish acronym for Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia .

At that stop , the group is supposed to pick up the governor of the Meta state , Alan Jara , who was abducted in 2001 .
The delegation then will receive instructions from FARC on how and where to proceed in the third and final leg Wednesday to collect Sigifredo Lopez , a former official in the city of Valle del Cauca kidnapped in 2003 .

FARC announced the release on December 21 and designated Cordoba as the coordinator .

Cordoba previously brokered unsuccessful negotiations in 2007 .

Many analysts see this unilateral act by the FARC as the first step toward an eventual peace accord with the government of President Alvaro Uribe .
Officials are not discounting further hostage releases .

The Colombian government recently has stepped up pressure on the rebels , offering rewards to the guerrillas if they surrender and free their hostages .

Earlier this month , two guerrillas fled their camp deep in the jungles of southern Colombia , bringing along two kidnap victims -- a 14-year-old boy and an adult man .
Both had been kidnapped in December .

Guerrillas have escaped with kidnap victims five times in the past couple of months .

The government has said the FARC 's military force has been severely compromised in recent months , but authorities still accuse the group of trafficking huge quantities of cocaine to finance its decades-old insurgency .

The government says 3,000 people remain kidnapped in Colombia and the FARC is responsible for 700 of them .

Among the kidnap victims was former presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt , who was freed in July with three American military contractors and 11 Colombian police and military members .

Security analysts say FARC has about 9,000 to 12,000 armed guerillas and several thousand supporters , mostly in rural areas .

The guerrilla group was established in 1964 as the military wing of the Colombian Communist Party .

The guerrillas operate mostly in Colombia but have carried out extortion , kidnappings and other activities in Venezuela , Panama and Ecuador , according to the Federation of American Scientists Intelligence Resource Program .

Each helicopter used in the latest operation will carry a crew of five and can travel five hours on a tank of fuel , said El Espectador newspaper , citing Gen. Freddy Padilla de Leon , the commander of Colombian military forces .
