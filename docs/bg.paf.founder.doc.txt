Cancer struggles inspire patient crusader - CNN.com
NEWPORT NEWS , Virginia ( CNN ) -- Long before she took on America 's embattled health-care system , Nancy Davenport-Ennis was riding high .
She was a national speaker for the homebuilding and real estate industry , teaching classes at the University of North Carolina and writing a textbook about selling new homes .
Her husband , Jack , ran a successful funeral parlor and they had two daughters in good private schools .
Then , Davenport-Ennis got breast cancer .

' My diagnosis was probably the best thing that ever happened in my life, ' Davenport-Ennis said .
' Until that diagnosis , I was so focused on my own family , my own community and my own career , that I really was not sensitized to what happens to you if you 're diagnosed with a life-threatening illness. '

But this is n't a self-help story .
It 's about a woman who got angry and decided to change the world .

Two years after her own diagnosis , a close friend of Davenport-Ennis was found to have advanced breast cancer .
' She was told there were no options for treatment, ' said Davenport-Ennis .
Cheryl Grimmel was 31 years old .
' She had a 12-year-old son , and she essentially was making legal arrangements for what was going to happen next .

' I just felt there was a travesty , that a 31-year-old woman needed to have a second opinion , that a 31-year-old woman needed to have options. '

Davenport-Ennis took charge of Grimmel 's case -- calling hospitals , calling Grimmel 's insurance company , calling her own doctors at Duke University Hospital and getting her into a clinical trial for an experimental drug .

But there was a problem .
Just days before Grimmel was scheduled to start chemotherapy , the insurance company said it would n't pay .
Grimmel 's parents scrambled to raise a $ 50,000 deposit -- mortgaging their house -- and over the next year , the Ennises helped the family raise more than $ 200,000 to continue treatment .

By then , Davenport-Ennis was free of her own cancer , and she threw herself into the project with the same energy that had once helped push homes up around the country .

She talked her way into the office of the state insurance commissioner and told him about Grimmel 's struggle .
When no assistance was forthcoming , Davenport-Ennis rounded up political professionals and took her case to the Virginia Legislature .

Less than a year later , there was a law requiring every health insurance company in Virginia to offer breast cancer patients a costly type of bone marrow transplant .

To her chagrin , Davenport-Ennis found she could n't really savor the victory .
It was n't enough .
So her coalition pushed , successfully , for similar laws in other states .

Treatment at Duke helped Grimmel live an additional 3 half years .
' Cheryl became a person that we loved and that we took care of day in and day out, ' said Davenport-Ennis .
When she died , the funeral was on New Year 's Eve .
On the way home , Davenport-Ennis turned to her husband and said she knew what had to be done .

' When I met Cheryl , and I lived her journey with her , I had long discussions with my God , who leads a lot of decisions in my life , and I argued with him for a long time, ' she said .
' I said , 'I am not the person to open this organization , but if you show me who the person is , I 'll go and help .

But Davenport-Ennis was n't one to wait for divine assistance .
A few months later , she found herself sitting alone in a blank , 10-by-10-foot room , in a Newport News , Virginia , office building , wondering just what she had gotten herself into .
It was the Patient Advocate Foundation , and before long , it was helping hundreds of patients in plights like Grimmel 's .

A few years later , with a small staff struggling , Davenport-Ennis begged daughters Beth and Fran to pitch in .
It was a tough sell , she said , 'when you have two adult daughters with magnificent careers , and you say , 'We know you have outstanding credentials , but we ca n't afford to pay for them .
Will you take a one-year leave of absence to come and help ?
' ' She laughs .
' It was a difficult conversation. '

But this is a woman not used to hearing 'no, ' not even from her own daughters .
Both are still with the foundation .
Her husband had helped co-found PAF .
With his daughters on board , he signed up as chief development officer .

Today the one-room office is gone , replaced by a neat , two-story building , and six more offices around the country .
The foundation has 106 employees and 162 volunteer attorneys .

The organization fielded 6.6 million requests for help last year , according to Davenport-Ennis , and took on 44,515 people as clients -- all with life-threatening or chronic and debilitating conditions .
Some need a pit bull to take on an insurance company .
Others have no insurance , while others have coverage but need financial assistance to buy medicine .
None pay for the help .
According to Davenport-Ennis , PAF is able to 'successfully resolve ' more than 98 percent of the cases it takes on .

Jack Ennis also knows what it 's like to be on the wrong end of a tough diagnosis .
Two years ago , he saw his doctor for an earache , only to learn that he had stage 4 oral-pharyngeal cancer .
The doctor gave him a 30 percent chance of living 100 more days .
But after seven weeks of therapy at Duke , a new round of tests found him cancer free .

' Here 's a doctor who 's been a surgeon for 30 years , and he 's crying, ' said Ennis , tearing up himself as he recalls the moment he heard the good news .
' He looked at me and said , 'All doctors feel like they 're entitled to a miracle .
And you 're my miracle .

It was a lot to handle , even for a family that 's used to dealing with crises .
But Davenport-Ennis said she 's driven by a sense of mission , and the memory of her friend .
' We learned from Cheryl 's illness that when you have a life-threatening illness , you need someone to go to bat for you today .
Not tomorrow , but today .
And that they 're going to be there for you , until the problem is solved. '
