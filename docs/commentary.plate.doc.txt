Plate: Let's lay down our right to bear arms - CNN.com
LOS ANGELES ( CNN ) -- Most days , it is not at all hard to feel proud to be an American .
But on days such as this , it is very difficult .

The pain that the parents of the slain students feel hits deep into everyone 's hearts .
At the University of California , Los Angeles , students are talking about little else .
It is not that they feel especially vulnerable because they are students at a major university , as is Virginia Tech , but because they are ( to be blunt ) citizens of High Noon America .

' High Noon ' is a famous film .
The 1952 Western told the story of a town marshal ( played by the superstar actor Gary Cooper ) who is forced to eliminate a gang of killers by himself .
They are eventually gunned down .

The use of guns is often the American technique of choice for all kinds of conflict resolution .
Our famous Constitution , about which many of us are generally so proud , enshrines -- along with the right to freedom of speech , press , religion and assembly -- the right to own guns .
That 's an apples and oranges list if there ever was one .

Not all of us are so proud and triumphant about the gun-guarantee clause .
The right to free speech , press , religion and assembly and so on seem to be working well , but the gun part , not so much .

Let me explain .
Some misguided people will focus on the fact that the 23-year-old student who killed his classmates and others at Virginia Tech was ethnically Korean .
This is one of those observations that 's 99.99 percent irrelevant .
What are we to make of the fact that he is Korean ?
Ban Ki-moon is also Korean !
Our brilliant new United Nations secretary general has not only never fired a gun , it looks like he may have just put together a peace formula for civil war-wracked Sudan -- a formula that escaped his predecessor .

So let 's just disregard all the hoopla about the race of the student responsible for the slayings .
These students were not killed by a Korean , they were killed by a 9 mm handgun and a .22-caliber handgun .

In the nineties , the Los Angeles Times courageously endorsed an all-but-complete ban on privately owned guns , in an effort to greatly reduce their availability .
By the time the series of editorials had concluded , the newspaper had received more angry letters and fiery faxes from the well-armed U.S. gun lobby than on any other issue during my privileged six-year tenure as the newspaper 's editorial page editor .

But the paper , by the way , also received more supportive letters than on any other issue about which it editorialized during that era .
The common sense of ordinary citizens told them that whatever Americans were and are good for , carrying around guns like costume jewelry was not on our Mature List of Notable Cultural Accomplishments .

' Guns do n't kill people, ' goes the gun lobby 's absurd mantra .
Far fewer guns in America would logically result in far fewer deaths from people pulling the trigger .
The probability of the Virginia Tech gun massacre happening would have been greatly reduced if guns were n't so easily available to ordinary citizens .

Foreigners sometimes believe that celebrities in America are more often the targets of gun violence than the rest of us .
Not true .
Celebrity shootings just make better news stories , so perhaps they seem common .
They 're not .
All of us are targets because with so many guns swishing around our culture , no one is immune -- not even us non-celebrities .

When the great pop composer and legendary member of the Beatles John Lennon was shot in 1980 in New York , many in the foreign press tabbed it a war on celebrities .
Now , some in the media will declare a war on students or some-such .
This is all misplaced .
The correct target of our concern needs to be guns .
America has more than it can possibly handle .
How many can our society handle ?
My opinion is : as close to zero as possible .

Last month , I was robbed at 10 in the evening in the alley behind my home .
As I was carrying groceries inside , a man with a gun approached me where my car was parked .
The gun he carried featured one of those red-dot laser beams , which he pointed right at my head .

Because I 'm anything but a James Bond type , I quickly complied with all of his requests .
Perhaps because of my rapid response ( it is called surrender ) , he chose not to shoot me ; but he just as easily could have .
What was to stop him ?

This occurred in Beverly Hills , a low-crime area dotted with upscale boutiques , restaurants and businesses -- a city best known perhaps for its glamour and celebrity sightings .

Oh , and police tell me the armed robber definitely was not Korean .
Not that I would have known one way or the other : Basically the only thing I saw or can remember was the gun , with the red dot , pointed right at my head .

A near-death experience does focus the mind .
We need to get rid of our guns .

Below you will find a small selection of these e-mails , some of which have been edited for length and spelling :

Eileen Lazur , King of Prussia , Pennsylvania I totally agree with Mr. Tom Plate regarding his anti-gun article .
The United States needs to make it more difficult to get guns .
It 's a no-brainer -- the fewer guns the fewer shootings .
Why do we even make automatic weapons ?
They should be outlawed .
I 'm sad that the U.S. has not acknowledged this .
I would gladly vote for a candidate who took a firm stand against the NRA !
It needs to happen now .

Juan Garcia , Syracuse , New York I 'm sorry you had experienced having a gun aimed at your head , but let 's assume the robber knew that more and more Americans have armed themselves .
Do you think he would have been brave enough to rob another armed person ?
Probably not .

D. Whilhelm , Edmond , Oklahoma A very short sighted argument , indeed .
I do n't have a gun and am not going to get one .
But the sad truth is that anti-gun laws will only stop law abiding citizens from having guns .
Those who murder and rob will not comply with these laws .
Illegal drugs are illegal , yet does that stop anyone from getting them that wants them ?
Gun control is a hurried reaction to try to solve our violence problem that goes far deeper than fire arms .

Ron Bell , Snellville , Georgia I could n't agree more .
The idea that private citazens owning one or more ( usually more ) guns makes them safer or helps them to ensure protection for their family and/or belongings is absolutely ludicrous .
It simply escalates matters and helps ensure that somebody is going to get hurt , usually very badly and almost always the most innocent party .

Mike , Minneapolis , Minnesota The right to bear arms was a construct designed to prevent the proliferation of governmental tyranny .
A constituency made up of a potentially armed militia served as a great deterrent against those with designs of establishing a new monarchy or dictatorship .
Believe it or not , a fledgling representative democracy had plenty to fear from a world , at best , unfamiliar , and at worst , openly hostile to this new form of self-governance .
Would Mr. Plate feel better about his citizenship if the lunatic in Virginia had strapped 100 pieces of dynamite to his body and blown himself up in a crowded area ?
Would he be any more comfortable living in this country if his assailant had used a knife instead of a pistol to commit a crime against his person ?

Laurence Hewitt , New York , New York I would just add one more thing to Mr. Plate 's well thought-out commentary .
The constitution stipulates that the right to bear arms is for the purpose of 'maintaining a standing militia .
' Which , in modern terms , outside of Iraq and the Golan Heights , refers to maintaining a national guard .
It does not say that every man , woman and child has the right to carry around a handgun , as the NRA would have you believe .

Brian , Seattle , Washington If the writer here had a gun , he could have defended himself !
I myself do not have a gun , but I can tell you if I ever felt compelled to defend myself or my family I want that right .
I do n't want to rely on someone else to protect me , because 9 out of 10 times , I 'd be dead .
As with any seen evil ( drugs , alcohol , etc ) , we 've shown in a free country that abolition does n't work , but I believe controlled regulation coupled with education can .

Matthew Brice , Fairbanks , Alaska I could not agree more .
This county is unnecessarily awash is guns .
The U.S. Constitution does guarantee the right to bear arms , but we need to fully appreciate the context with which the right was framed .
It was penned over 200 hundred years ago in a much different world .
When was the last time a person with a flat tire on the freeway was required to subsistence hunt until help arrived ?
While I believe that most persons ( including myself ) can responsibly own a gun , I would freely give up that right to keep guns out of those that do not .

Mark Tegtman , Ft. Collins , Colorado Typical liberal view....The guns did all of the killing ; they just happened to be in the hands of a madman who went about the process of obtaining guns through legal means .
Had one student or teacher had a gun in their possession , this whole incident might have been very different .
Take guns away from responsible people and there will be a major catastrophe in this wonderful country .
