Officials: Sebelius in lead for Health and Human Services post - CNN.com
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Kansas Gov .
Kathleen Sebelius is a leading contender to become the next secretary of the Health and Human Services department , two senior administration officials told CNN .
However , the officials stressed that President Obama is still checking out several other potential nominees for the critical job of shepherding his health-care reform plan through Congress .

White House spokesman Bill Burton cautioned that 'no final decision has been made ' on the post , which is still vacant after the first pick , former Sen. Tom Daschle , stepped aside after questions were raised about his failure to pay more than $ 100,000 in taxes for use of a car and driver .

' There are other candidates still very much in the mix, ' said Burton , who declined to name the others .
He would only say the president will make a decision 'soon ' about the Cabinet selection .

CNN reported earlier this month that Sebelius met in Washington with senior White House adviser Valerie Jarrett about the job , a sign that the administration has been giving her a close look since Daschle dropped out .

The officials noted Sebelius has a good personal relationship with Obama and remained in the running for the vice presidential slot until near the end of the process .
She was also considered for other Cabinet posts .

The other candidates who have been considered , according to Democratic officials , include Sen. Ron Wyden , D-Oregon , Tennessee Gov .
Phil Bredesen , a Democrat , and former Democratic Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey .
