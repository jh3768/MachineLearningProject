Tips for using cell phones overseas - CNN.com
( Travel + Leisure ) -- If you 're among those frequent travelers whose growing gadgetry collections occasionally make you suspect that technology does not , in fact , simplify your life , you 're not alone .
Take recent reports by new AT&amp ; T iPhone customers of roaming charges in the thousands of dollars and novel-length bills in the mail ( customer Justine Ezarik posted a YouTube video of herself opening a 300-page bill that AT&amp ; T sent to her in a box ) .

What 's the problem ?
It turns out that the iPhone automatically checks e-mail and performs other Internet data updates , even when the phone function is off .
Not a problem in the U.S. , where the AT&amp ; T Wireless plan for the iPhone includes unlimited call time and data transfers .
But that 's not true abroad -- and roaming rates add up quickly .

Verizon charges from $ 1.49 per minute in many countries to $ 2.49 on cruise ships .
T-Mobile international rates vary , and roaming can be as expensive as $ 4.99 per minute .
Make a 20-minute call from Russia on AT&amp ; T , and you 're looking at a $ 100 charge .

Fortunately , staying connected on the road internationally can be easier -- and less expensive -- than your provider might have you believe .
One solution to that problem is voicemail , available with an upgraded Skype account .
Skype , of course , launched back in 2003 and picked up speed and market share after its purchase by eBay .
Its Voice over Internet Protocol ( VoIP ) technology allows you to avoid costly phone frequencies ; just log on to the Net and you can make calls for a few cents a minute -- and add voicemail for $ 20 per year .

Or , you can find a hotel that 's using VoIP : JW Marriott 's Wired for Business program in the U.S. and Canada lets you make all the domestic calls you want and get online for $ 9.95 a day .
Select international JW Marriotts have it , too , though it 's not a brand-wide initiative .

Of course , the competition for international wireless callers is heated , and that means innovation ca n't be far behind .
One option is the new phone from Cubic Telecom , a phone that , unlike most phones from Verizon or Sprint , works in 160 countries , and whose service plan , MaxRoam.com , cuts costs up to 75 percent of many carriers by letting you set up local phone numbers in several different countries .
You pay varying but lower costs between countries , though the service benefits those who want to call you from the U.S. more than it benefits you while traveling abroad .
