Senate Democrats offer deal to break energy bill standstill  - CNN.com
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid surprised Republicans on Monday by offering them a chance to vote this week on four GOP-backed amendments to an energy bill , including one that would expand offshore oil drilling .

The Senate has been gridlocked for days on the bill -- which would attempt to curb speculation in the oil futures market -- as both parties argued over which amendments will be put to a vote .

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Kentucky , said he was 'very encouraged ' by Reid 's proposal , but McConnell added he would have to confer with his leadership team .

The possible breakthrough comes days before Congress recesses for August and lawmakers return home to face constituents anxious for relief at fuel pumps .

GOP leaders met late Monday and were expected to discuss the plan with the full Republican membership Tuesday .
But two leadership aides said Republicans probably would seek more than four amendments .

Republicans had been insisting they should be allowed to offer two dozen or more amendments .

' It has to be north of four, ' one of the Republican aides said .
Another added , 'I mean , come on , that 's not negotiating. '

But a Democratic leadership aide predicted Republicans 'wo n't take yes for an answer .
' And Sen. Charles Schumer , the Senate 's third-ranking Democrat , said Democrats believe Republicans 'will say nothing is ever enough. '

' These are there four major amendments, ' Schumer said .
' We 'd love to have a deal , but I thought Harry 's offer was a very generous offer. '

Reid , D-Nevada , said Democrats would allow votes on GOP amendments that would permit new drilling on the outer continental shelf ; the development of oil shale in Western states ; construction of new nuclear power plants ; and broader legislation that Republicans have dubbed 'find more , use less. '

That legislation includes expanded offshore drilling , conservation initiatives , the improvement of battery technology , and language to curb speculation in the oil futures market .

Democratic leaders have generally opposed efforts to repeal a 1981 law barring most offshore drilling .

Reid said Democrats would offer four of their own proposals , but did n't specify what those would be .
He said all amendments would need 60 votes to pass , a threshold that could make it difficult for any of them to succeed .

Republicans , buoyed by recent polls showing a majority of Americans support new offshore drilling , have said they are confident they can get more than 50 senators to support expanded drilling , if not the 60 votes needed to pass .

Energy legislation also has been stalled in the House .

A bipartisan 'energy working group ' of 28 lawmakers hopes to break the impasse this week by proposing a compromise that couples new offshore drilling with conservation and renewable energy programs .

Yet House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , a California Democrat , says she wo n't allow a vote on a bill that includes new offshore oil drilling .

Also this week , the House is expected to vote on its version of an antispeculation bill .
Republican leaders have not decided if they will support the bill .
