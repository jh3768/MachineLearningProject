Comment: Obama, what about the Middle East? - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- Sometimes you say a lot when you say nothing .

Listen to Barack Obama .
We know his plans on subjects big and small , ranging from a multi-billion-dollar boost for the US economy ( 'we have to act and act now ' ) to the next White House pet ( 'we 're going to have a big rambunctious dog ' ) .

But we do n't know if he has a plan to help end the bloodshed in the Middle East .

As Israel attacks Gaza in the name of its war on terror , and Palestinians plead for help in the name of decency , Obama has kept his opinions to himself .

Instead , he tells reporters that President George W. Bush alone speaks for the United States .

' We ca n't have two administrations running foreign policy at the same time, ' he said this week .
' We simply ca n't do it. '

Long before the shooting started , Hamas seemed optimistic about Obama .

A senior Hamas figure named Ahmed Yousef said during the US presidential election campaign that Obama held out the prospect of change .

' We like Mr. Obama and we hope he will win the election .

It could be that once he 's sworn-in , a week from Tuesday , we 'll hear Obama speak eloquently and at length about what he wants for Gaza .

It could also be that we 'll hear relatively little , because Obama knows the old political maxim that to govern is to choose .
The president-elect has an enormous job ahead , invigorating America 's economy , getting the US army out of Iraq and making good on the countless promises that won him the presidency .

Gaza is a profound humanitarian crisis but at the same time a distraction from problems closer to home .

The easiest thing to do is for Obama to maintain Washington 's longstanding support for Israel

Anything which can be construed as support for Hamas , which the US officially designates as a terrorist organization , would be a big change and a challenge for the administration .

No president can be uninterested in the Middle East because there is so much at stake .

But some presidents have paid more attention to it than others .

Keep listening and we 'll find out what he chooses .
