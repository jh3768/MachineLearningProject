What do you want from your boss this holiday season? - CNN.com
During the homestretch leading up to the new year , bosses often become generous and kind -- traits no one knew they were capable of exhibiting .

Credit the holidays , the year-end bonuses or the paid time off for your boss ' newfound transformation from Scrooge to philanthropist .
Regardless , you might as well enjoy it before it disappears .

Tradition suggests the holiday season -- whether or not you observe any holidays -- is the prime opportunity to get all those things you 've been wanting .
While you might look to your family or friends to get the expensive watch you 've been hinting at , you hope the boss will give you the workplace treats only he or she can dole out : a raise , a promotion or an unlimited expense account .

When you think about what the average employee wants from his or her boss , you might expect starry-eyed wishes that no one ( short of a fairy godmother ) could grant .

Given the chance , however , many employees would ask the boss for simple upgrades in their daily lives .
As nice as the corner office would be , signs of respect would be just as appreciated .

A little respect

If she could have anything in the ( professional ) world , Catherine K. , a worker who asked to remain anonymous , wishes her boss would uphold his end of their professional agreement .

' If you could actually give me a performance review this year , that would be splendid, ' she asks in her imaginary wish list .
' And maybe a cost-of-living raise .
I have n't gotten either in almost two years now. '

Megan R. wants her hard-nosed boss to give her a little leeway when conditions are out of her control .

' Be flexible, ' she beseeches .
' And when you say you 're flexible , mean it .
Life happens. '

Her boss ' rigidity is n't only an annoyance , it 's also a sign that he does n't value her , her efforts or , perhaps most importantly , her time .
She also wishes they could have fewer meetings , as many of them are 'pointless .
' And when she 's out of tasks for the day , she 'd like for her boss to let her go home rather than stay and do nothing .
She adds to the list , 'Stop micromanaging me. '

At first glance , you might think Megan and Catherine are complainers or that their bosses are unfit to lead anyone .
Yet , their wish lists are n't comprised of outlandish requests that will upend the company hierarchy .

Many of these issues can be addressed in one-on-one meetings , which will hopefully be more productive than what Megan normally sits through .

Many bosses might not recognize a gap exists between what they 're doing and what their employees perceive .
Catherine 's boss might think she 's doing such a good job that she does n't need a performance review .
Perhaps financial reasons prevent him from giving her a raise , but he 's never explained it to her .

Megan 's boss might show his support by being active in his employees ' daily activities , but he ends up coming across as overbearing instead .
This holiday season , the employees might have to give the boss a little nudge to get what they want .

Lighthearted gifts ... sorta

Several employee requests are humorous , but like any good comedy , truth lurks beneath the jokes .
Each wish , even when funny , suggests some bosses are n't taking the time to check in with their employees and make sure everyone 's on the same page .
As a result , employees wonder if they 're even on the boss ' radar .

Here are a few gifts employees would like wrapped in a pretty box this year :

& # 8226 ; 'Please do n't turn off the heat again this year and open all the doors when it 's 30 degrees outside .
It 's bad enough that we freeze in the summer with 60-degree air conditioner settings .
If you must turn our office into an icebox , maybe you could get us new coats for Christmas ?
I promise to use mine all year long. '

& # 8226 ; 'In the spirit of the holidays , perhaps you could stop saying , 'You do n't want to have kids .
People without kids are just as happy as people who do have them .
' Little do you know I 'm hoping to be pregnant by Christmas .
I wo n't be the jolliest employee if you keep making comments like this. '

& # 8226 ; 'Think before you speak ; speak in complete sentences ; and finish a sentence within a minute .
It should n't take you five minutes to speak two sentences ! '

& # 8226 ; 'Get me an office that does n't block the sunlight .
I 'm turning into a vampire here. '

& # 8226 ; 'One thing I want for Christmas is for the bathroom in our small office to be soundproofed .
My desk is separated from the single unisex bathroom by a five-foot cube wall , a five-foot walkway and the bathroom door -- which is n't nearly enough .
I can hear everything that goes on in there. '
