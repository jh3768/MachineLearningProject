Mo Ibrahim, founder of Celtel - CNN.com
LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- Mo Ibrahim is a man who believes in Africa ; and the continent has been good to him .

Putting his career on the line at the age of 43 -- he quit his job at British Telecom to start his own company .

He also started mobile phone operator Celtel which is in 14 African countries .
Cashing in and now rich beyond his wildest dreams , he now has his own foundation .

CNN 's Todd Benjamin caught up with him in London and began by asking him about investing in Africa .

Ibrahim : Africa was perceived , it still is to some extent , as a place which is very difficult to do business in .
I do n't share that view .
Africa has 53 countries , Todd .
And you find that three or four countries in these 53 are dominating the news .

There is , I think , a problem with image for Africa .
Whenever there is a problem with image , whenever there is a gap between reality and perception , there is a good business there .
I 'm an African .
If I do n't do it , who else will do it ?

Benjamin : With your considerable fortune , you 've set aside $ 400 million for a foundation that focuses on governance in Africa , good governance .
And you have an index to measure whether certain criteria are being met , and you have a prize , $ 5 million , to a leader who exhibits exemplary governance .
What do you hope to accomplish with that ?

Ibrahim : We want the civil society to own the issue of political governance .
It 's the most important issue really : governance .
Without good governance , Africa will go nowhere .

Second objective , we also want to encourage and support successful African leadership .
African leaders work really under severe limitations and constraints .
If you think what keeps our prime minister here in England awake at night -- will it be the hip replacement operation queue now is three months instead of two months ?

You take one of our African leaders .
I have half a million HIV positive .
I have problems with malaria , power generation , kids need schools , not enough schools for them , fresh water .
So many issues .
I really wonder how those guys sleep at night .

So what we want to do is to support those leaders who manage really to face these problems , to take millions of people out of poverty , to build a just society , a democratic society .

Benjamin : You 're an immensely wealthy man now -- worth at least a billion dollars , maybe more -- and yet I 've read where you 've said that money 's not important to you .

Ibrahim : I hope you or your audience will believe me .
I never set out really to build a financial empire or to be a wealthy man .
I just enjoy what I 'm doing and money happened .
It 's a nice bi-product .
It was an enabler .
And I see the value of money really as an enabler to enable me to do the things I love to do .
And I 'm so grateful that I 've made this money because I 'm able to go back to Africa now and do something like the foundation .

Benjamin : For any entrepreneur , passion is the key .
You ca n't be thinking about money .
You have to be passionate about what you do .

Ibrahim : Absolutely .
Absolutely. You need to love it .
You need to breathe it .
You need to sleep it .
You need to wake it .
It is your life and you and your project are one .
Look at me .
I feel so young .
I 'm 60 years old but I feel like 20 years old because I love what I do .

Benjamin : What do you want your legacy to be ?

Ibrahim : A good African boy .
That 's all I want , just a good African boy who did not forget his people .
