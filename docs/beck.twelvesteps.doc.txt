Glenn Beck: America needs a 12-step program - CNN.com
NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- My name is Glenn Beck , and I am a recovering alcoholic .

It took me a lot of years and a lot of pain to be able to say those words and really believe them .
Along the way , I was arrogant , greedy and self-destructive .

But the worst part was that I did n't see any of it .

Even at the lowest , darkest points of my life , I still thought of myself as that successful guy who everyone loved .
I was the life of the party , the guy who could do no wrong -- the guy who everyone else only wished they could be .
At least that 's what I thought .

Now I know better .
People were n't looking at me with envy ; they were looking at me with disgust as they watched me throw away everything I had worked so hard for .

I think America can relate .

Through hard work and unwavering principles , America took itself from a far-fetched idea to the greatest , most compassionate , most free country the world has ever known .
But as our success has grown , so has our arrogance .

We 've compromised our values , sold out our principles and used our freedoms to justify giving more power to the government .
In the first century of America 's life , its government was afraid of its citizens .
Now , it 's the other way around .

Maybe America should consider starting on the same kind of 12-step program that 's helped millions of other addicts who could n't see that they were slowly killing themselves .
Here 's my version of it , condensed to six steps since I know that Americans are way too lazy to stick around for all 12 .

Step One : Admit we are not powerless .

Take a look at our Constitution .
Not just a transcript ; find an actual picture of it .
The first three words , 'We the People, ' are at least four times larger than the others .
Do you think that was an accident ?
Of course not .
Our framers chose those words , and made them that size , because they knew they were the answer to any problem we would ever face .

Step Two : Believe that a power greater than ourselves can restore us to sanity .

I think this one pretty much speaks for itself .

Step Three : Decide to take our power back .

A recent polls says 81 percent of Americans now say that our country is on the wrong track .
If you 're one of those people , who do you blame ?
The Bush administration ?
Congress ? The media ?

Here 's a crazy idea : How about blaming ourselves ?

If you do n't like the fact that your city has led the country in poverty and homelessness for the last 10 years , then ELECT SOMEONE NEW .
Stop voting for the same people from the same party every year .

Our power has n't gone away ( see Step One ) , it 's just been masked by politicians who are tearing us apart for their own gain .
We need to reclaim that power , and then we need to use it .

Step Four : Make a complete and fearless moral inventory .

Alcoholics are n't exactly big fans of introspection and self-examination , but this is one of the most important steps to recovery .

What are America 's faults ?
What are our assets ?
By taking stock of both , we can start to work on maximizing our strengths and eliminating our weaknesses .
It sounds simple , but when 's the last time you really thought about what America does right ?
That brings me to Step Five .

Step Five : Admit our wrongs , and our rights .

We 're constantly reminded about America 's faults and flaws , but what about our achievements ?

If you want to teach our kids about Vietnam , that 's fine , but you better also teach them about World War II .
And if you want to talk about our wars , you better also talk about our welfare .
America is one of the most charitable countries in the history of the world , yet our mistakes are always glorified far more than our generosity .
That needs to be reversed .

Step Six : Be ready to remove our defects .

Just like an alcoholic , we simply can not go from sleeping on the street to perfection overnight .
This is a big ship , and it takes a long time to turn it around .

But we have to start somewhere , and the best place is with the defects that almost all of us agree on .
For example , does anyone really believe that being addicted to Saudi Arabia 's oil is a good idea ?
What about China owning billions of our debt ?
Speaking of debt , what about the fact that we 've saddled our children with $ 53 trillion in future Social Security and Medicare obligations ?

But before we can address any problems , we have to first admit we have them .
Many of us are in denial about just how divided we 've become .
We think that it 's just the election or the war that 's tearing us apart , but the truth is , it 's much larger than that .
We 're every bit as arrogant , greedy and self-destructive as I was when I hit bottom .

Fortunately , it 's not hopeless .
It never is .
If a program can work on a rodeo clown like me , it can definitely work for a country as great as ours .
But until we 're able to stand up and say , 'Hello , my name is America and I have a problem, ' we 'll never even have a chance .
