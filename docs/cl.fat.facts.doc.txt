Fast facts on fats: What to eat, what to avoid - CNN.com
From curbside snack carts to four-star restaurants , New York City chefs have until next summer to rid their kitchens of trans fat .
It 's a bold move , but a necessary one , according to city health officials .

' When you look at the evidence , there 's no question artificial trans fat increases the risk for coronary heart disease, ' says Sonia Angell , M.D. , director of cardiovascular disease prevention and control at New York City 's Department of Health .

' The most conservative estimates show that the replacement of these fats with heart-healthy alternatives can decrease coronary artery disease risk by 6 percent , and it is likely even higher. '

In fact , a recent Harvard University study showed that women with low blood levels of trans fat are three times less likely to develop heart disease .

The Big Apple 's impending trans fat ban is making other cities , food companies , and scientific experts pay closer attention to the increasingly complex relationships between dietary fat and health .
Here 's the latest on fats , including where each is found , what it does , and how much or how little to eat .

Trans fat

There are two types of trans fat : the kind that occurs naturally in small amounts in animal products , and the artificial kind produced by adding hydrogen to liquid oils so they remain solid at room temperature , which helps extend a food 's shelf life .
So far no studies have examined how natural trans fat impacts health , but the artificial kind raises levels of LDL ( 'bad ' ) cholesterol and lowers HDL ( 'good ' ) cholesterol , raising the risk of heart disease .

& # 8226 ; Where it 's found : Most commercially produced fried foods , baked goods , and stick margarines are made with artificial trans fat .
Natural trans fat can be found in red meat , milk , butter , and cheese .

& # 8226 ; How much to eat : As little as possible .
The American Heart Association ( AHA ) suggests limiting trans fat to less than one percent of your daily calories , about two grams if you follow a 2,000-calorie-per-day plan .
That figure includes artificial trans fat as well as natural , since natural trans fat sources are often high in another type of fat linked to heart-disease risk factors-saturated fat .
' If you 're mindful that you want to decrease both trans fat and saturated fat , you 're in a good position .
I think some people are so focused on trans fat that they forget about saturated fat, ' says Alice Lichtenstein , D.Sc. , director of the Cardiovascular Nutrition Laboratory at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging in Boston , Massachusetts .

& # 8226 ; Recent news : The food world is working at warp speed to find replacements for artificial trans fat .
In addition to New York , eight other large American cities --including Los Angeles , California ; Philadelphia , Pennsylvania ; and Boston -- have legislation pending to limit or ban artificial trans fat .
' It 's just a matter of time before these fats virtually disappear from the American landscape, ' says William Connor , M.D. , a researcher at Oregon State Health Sciences University .

& # 8226 ; Trans fat fine print : A product must contain less than 0.5 grams of trans fat per serving in order to bear a 'no trans fat ' label , according to the Food and Drug Administration .
However , such products may still contain up to 0.49 grams of trans fat .
To keep your intake low , stick to recommended serving sizes and read ingredients lists ; they 're arranged in order , so the presence of partially hydrogenated oil can provide a clue as to the presence of artificial trans fat in a 'trans fat-free ' product .

Saturated fat

This type of fat raises LDL cholesterol and sets the stage for heart disease by encouraging the formation of plaque in arteries .

& # 8226 ; Where it 's found : Animal products like whole milk , cream , butter , lard , and fatty cuts of meat .
Also a component of cocoa butter and tropical oils ( palm , palm kernel , and coconut ) .

& # 8226 ; How much to eat : Less than 10 percent of your total calories per day ( 20 grams if you eat 2,000 calories ) is a good starting point .
For optimal heart health , the AHA recommends seven percent ( 16 grams ) .

& # 8226 ; Recent news : Just one meal high in saturated fat may damage blood vessels and hinder the ability of HDL cholesterol to protect arteries .
Normally , HDL guards blood vessels from inflammation that contributes to artery-clogging plaque , says Stephen Nicholls , M.D. , a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation .
Not so after a meal high in saturated fat .
When Nicholls and colleagues fed 14 healthy volunteers two meals of carrot cake and a milk shake-one made with highly saturated coconut oil and one with polyunsaturated safflower oil-two things happened : The ability of blood vessels to expand and contract ( a sign of healthy arteries ) and the anti-inflammatory action of HDL were impaired for as much as six hours after the high saturated fat meal .
In contrast , when the cake and milk shake were made with polyunsaturated fat , arterial and HDL functions improved .
Just how much saturated fat was in that test meal ?
' We likened it to people eating a double cheeseburger , fries , and a shake , which , unfortunately , is not that uncommon a meal, ' Nicholls says .

Polyunsaturated fat

This type of fat helps reduce blood cholesterol levels when substituted for saturated fats .
One variety , omega-3 fatty acids , also helps lower blood pressure , control inflammation , and protect against irregular heartbeats .

& # 8226 ; Where it 's found : Vegetable oils like safflower , sunflower , sesame , corn , and soy , and nuts and seeds .
Omega-3s are found in fatty fish , such as salmon and mackerel , flaxseed , and walnuts .

& # 8226 ; How much to eat : Authorities say 40 to 78 grams in a 2,000-calorie diet should come from fat , with polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats comprising the bulk .
However , there is no specific recommended amount for either .

The AHA puts omega-3s in a separate category and suggests two to three meals of fatty fish a week .
Two components of omega-3 fatty acid molecules have different benefits : EPA ( eicosapentaenoic acid ) helps alleviate arterial inflammation and prevent blood platelets from clumping together , while DHA ( docosahexaenoic acid ) is valuable to the retina and brain .
Plant sources of omega-3s confer heart-health benefits similar to those of other foods rich in polyunsaturated fats , but because the chemical structure of the omega-3 fatty acid they contain ( alpha-linolenic acid , or ALA ) is different , the body does not convert it as readily to EPA or DHA , Connor says .

& # 8226 ; Recent news : Two studies from the University of Pittsburgh suggest omega-3s found in fish may help improve mood and increase gray matter in the brain .
In the first , researchers demonstrated that people with high blood levels of omega-3s tended to be more agreeable and less likely to report mild symptoms of depression than those with low levels .
In the second study , researchers uncovered a possible mechanism behind the mood differences : People with high blood levels of omega-3s have more gray matter in the areas of the brain linked to mood .
Although preliminary , the findings provide increasing support for including omega-3s in a healthful diet .

Monounsaturated fat

Monounsaturated fat helps lower blood cholesterol levels when substituted for saturated fat in the diet .

& # 8226 ; Where it 's found : Olives , avocados , and olive , canola , and peanut oils .

& # 8226 ; How much to eat : Again , roughly two-thirds of the fat you eat should be unsaturated , either monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fat .

& # 8226 ; Recent news : Monounsaturated fat may help protect against heart disease and diabetes , particularly among people with a cluster of conditions-insulin resistance , high blood pressure , high cholesterol levels , and big waistlines-referred to as metabolic syndrome .
A recent Italian study put 180 men and women with metabolic syndrome on either a low-calorie Mediterranean-style diet rich in monounsaturated fats , fruits , vegetables , and whole grains or a diet of 30 percent of calories from any type of fat .
At the study 's end two years later , half of the subjects who followed the Mediterranean-style diet were no longer diagnosed with metabolic syndrome .
' Compared to their baseline values the Mediterranean group had a significant increase in HDL and a decrease in both triglycerides [ a type of blood fat similar to cholesterol ] and blood sugar , all good changes, ' says Kathy McManus , M.S. , R.D. , of Harvard 's Brigham and Women 's Hospital in Boston .

How to keep track of your daily intake

The best tools for keeping track of your intake of fats are the Food and Drug Administration Daily Values , the percentages listed on all nutrition labels .
For example , the Daily Value ( DV ) for total fat , based on a 2,000-calorie diet , is 65 grams ( g ) or 30 percent of calories from fat .
A food containing 13g of total fat per serving would state on the label that its DV for fat is 20 percent .
That means one serving of this food contains 20 percent of total fat you should eat in a given day .
