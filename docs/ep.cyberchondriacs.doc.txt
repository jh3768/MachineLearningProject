Are you a 'cyberchondriac'? - CNN.com
Empowered Patient , a regular feature from CNN Medical News correspondent Elizabeth Cohen , helps put you in the driver 's seat when it comes to health care .

ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) -- First-year medical students are some of the biggest hypochondriacs around .
Bombarded with information about every disease under the sun , they start to imagine they have them all .
In their minds , every mole is skin cancer .
A nosebleed is surely a sign of a tumor .
Headache ? Must be skyrocketing blood pressure .

' People get terribly anxious, ' says Dr. Arthur Barsky , professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School .
' One woman who came to see me was convinced she had melanoma .
She brought in 20 pages of color photos of various skin lesions , trying to figure out which one looked most like hers. '

And now , because of the Internet , we can all be first-year medical students .
We can all develop what 's called 'medical student syndrome .
' We get basic information , and not necessarily a lot of context , and we 're off and running toward a conclusion that may be completely wrong .

Of course , health information on the Internet can be truly useful .
But how do you know when you 're using it constructively , and when you 've gone off on a medical wild goose chase ?
' I think it 's fairly easy to cross that line, ' says Robin DiMatteo , a professor of psychology at the University of California , Riverside .

So how do you know when you 've become a 'cyberchondriac ' ?

You may be a cyberchondriac if .. .

... you feel worse after Web surfing instead of better

' If research on the Internet helps to make you feel empowered , and engaged in a dialogue with your doctor , it 's helpful, ' DiMatteo says .
' But if it makes your heart rate go up , that 's potentially problematic. '

Or to put it another way : 'If you feel more scared and confused after being on the computer for half an hour , that 's not good, ' says Dr. Vicki Rackner , a surgeon and patient advocate .

... your doctor 's reassurances do n't help

' I do n't have a problem with people fishing around on the Internet to see what diseases they might have, ' Barsky says .
' For most people , a doctor 's reassurances that they 're fine is adequate .
I worry about the people for whom that is n't enough , and whose concerns persist and go right back on the Internet. '

... you move quickly from suspicion to conviction

If you quickly become convinced your shaking hands are Parkinson 's disease , or your sore throat is an immune deficiency , you need to back away , our panel of experts says .
Investigate your symptoms if you like , but leave the diagnosing to the doctors .

How to avoid becoming a cyberchondriac

Barsky suggests putting limits on your surfing right from the start .

' Plan in advance what you want to find out , what the question is you 're trying to answer , and how much time you 're willing to spend on it, ' he says .
' If you find yourself exceeding those limits , you should ratchet it down. '

Rackner has advice based on her own experience as a medical student .

' I was studying for an exam on the pancreas , and I became convinced I had a rare type of pancreatic tumor .
I thought , 'I do n't need to study because I 'm going to die, ' ' Rackner remembers .

What snapped her out of it ?
A good night 's sleep and an honest discussion with herself .

' When you 're off on a medical wild goose chase , you disconnect yourself from your intuition .
Ask yourself , do you really have this disease ?
The answer will almost always be 'no .
