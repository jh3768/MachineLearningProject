American car owners want automakers held accountable - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- Tracy Dupire of Worthington , Indiana , loves to drive her 2002 Ford Mustang convertible with the top down when the weather is nice .
She 's always had an American car and hopes she always will .

' It 's hard to rationalize sending all of our money overseas .
You have to buy American products and back American workers, ' says Dupire .

The question of value in American-based auto-manufacturers is coming to a head as President Obama advocates for a bailout of two of the Big Three auto manufacturers and asks the companies to present a plan for progress .

General Motors and Chrysler requested a combined $ 21.6 billion Tuesday on top of existing federal loans due to worsening demand for cars and trucks .
Ford said it has enough money for the time being to make due without the bailout .

Dupire wants to see the American-based auto manufacturers supported with conditions and close supervision .

' I think they should be held accountable for every dime we give them .
I do n't think we should give our money away without getting something back from it .
It 's not enough to say , 'Oh we 're going to fix it .
' We need to have a plan .

Auto manufacturers waited too long to make changes and are paying the price for imprudent extravagance , Dupire says .
' It 's just a slap in the face to America .
I have to get by on a budget , why should n't they have to ? '

But Dupire says American car makers still produce a good product .
As long as owners attend to their scheduled maintenance , they 're going to have a good car that lasts , she says .

Kelly R. Verhelst of Oostburg , Wisconsin , says her family always buys American cars and she feels doing so helps her country .

' I do n't always agree with the big labor unions and management styles but there is just something about American pride .
Our country has been bombarded with foreign-made products from clothing to electronics. '

Daniel Luke Diaz of Diamond Bar , California , has only bought American cars his entire life -- he even drove a Hummer during his time in the military .
He says , for the most part , American cars provide good value .

He also says he feels a responsibility to buy American .

By buying foreign cars , 'You might as well be laying off the American autoworkers yourself and handing their paychecks to those foreign automakers personally, ' says Diaz .

The American auto industry can be turned around if top executives renew their focus on quality construction and better materials , says Diaz .
' I believe Americans want cars to be as durable as they were 20 years ago .
No cutting corners. '

He says foreign automakers have used a 'quantity-over-quality strategy ' that flooded markets and made the cars seem more reliable .
Marketing is a huge part of the solution for turning around the auto companies , he says .

' American consumers simply want to know the American cars on the road will last , will have a long-term warranty , and that parts will be readily available and labeled 'Made in the USA .

Dan Gray of Belle Mead , New Jersey , an MPGomatic.com car reviewer , posted a video on iReport.com describing his own impressions of American cars .
He says many perform as well as any imports and there are several models he highly recommends .

' We need to keep our factories going and our people employed .
Give the American car companies a shot. '

But Nicholas Coday of Eugene , Oregon , says he finds cars from the so-called Big Three to be inferior to imports .
He views the bailout plans as a 'necessary evil ' since the auto industry is so large and employs so many people .
' I think the autoworkers are being hurt in the end as they are given a false sense of security by the bailout and the [ auto workers ] union .
It does not matter how much money we pump into the company if consumers can not afford their vehicles or would rather buy vehicles from their competitors. '

Coday says the Ford and Chevy models he has owned developed serious mechanical problems , while the Hondas he later bought had only minor 'cosmetic ' issues .

He singled out Ford as the only company of the Big Three he feels 'has a clue ' and coincidentally is n't asking for the bailout money .

' They have realized that not everyone wants an SUV or a truck and they can not afford the cost of a Mustang , so they have rolled out affordable models such as the Focus and Fusion , which I have seen good reviews on. '

Another 'unsatisfied ' American car owner is Concordia University student Suraj Suba of Montreal , Quebec .
He likes his Chrysler Intrepid but says styling and fuel efficiency could be better .

' The way I see it , they [ should ] have a lot of power .
You [ should ] feel like you 're driving a manly car when you 're driving an American car .
It does n't feel flimsy , and it does n't feel like it 's going to break. '

He views Ford 's own strides in these areas as reasons why the company has n't yet asked for federal money .

' The whole American-made , Ford-tough .
... That 's what 's lacking at GM and Chrysler .
It does n't have that pride. '
