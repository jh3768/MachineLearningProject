Eco-horror films shocking us into action - CNN.com
CNN -- There 's a new wave of horror films stalking the box office .

You can forget the torture porn of 'Saw ' and 'Hostel ' - in fact these new films are marked by a distinct lack of blood and guts .
But there is no doubting their ability to chill audiences to the core : Welcome to the world of eco-horror .

Unlike most horror films these movies are n't fiction , they are serious documentaries tackling the big issues of our time .
But the message is still : Be afraid .

The most recent addition to the scene is French director Irena Salina 's , 'Flow ' , which shows how the effects of climate change coupled with widespread privatization of the world 's fresh water supply has created a world water cartel with grim consequences for us all .

Wired magazine called it 'the scariest movie at the Sundance Film Festival' .

The film is a call to arms to resist the quiet corporate takeover of the stuff of life , and as such it taps into a widespread uncertainty about the way the world seems to be heading .

There is a lot of fear around now as the crunch on resources and looming threat of catastrophic climate change creates a deep and profound urban malaise .

That fear is finding its voice in these new documentary films that explore our future - and most cast a pall of gloom over life on this planet if we do n't change our ways quickly .
Feel-good these movies are n't .

The film that kick-started the trend was the Oscar-winning 'An Inconvenient Truth ' , in which Al Gore stands like a don in a lecture theatre delivering a power-point style talk about how global warming will affect the planet , interspersed with personal meditations on nature .

The film made $ 49 million at the box office - $ 24 million in the U.S. alone - which is not bad business for a film without action or special effects .

Hot on his heels , Leonardo DiCaprio 's 'The 11th Hour ' presented a similar -- if markedly more mawkish -- eulogy for a doomed planet , the bleakness of the message given a slight lift by the familiar presence of the actor .

Despite -- or perhaps because of -- a perceived 'dumbing down ' of TV , in increasingly complex times cinema-goers seem more than willing to pay to be educated , rather than just entertained .

The mass-market for serious films had been proven by Michael Moore with 'Bowling for Columbine ' and 'Fahrenheit 9/11 ' , which made $ 58 million and $ 220 million respectively .

Movies that help make sense of the world

Britain 's much-loved broadcaster Sir David Attenborough released two films , 'Are We Changing Planet Earth ' and 'Can We Save Planet Earth, ' both of which were screened in prime-time slots on BBC 1 , the UK 's main terrestrial channel .

The calmness of his delivery in marked contrast to the seriousness of the message .

' The Day After Tomorrow ' proved that climate change could be a blockbuster , even if it did sacrifice science to meet the demands of an action film .

Popular concern about global warming has acted as a springboard and fired interest in other related issues .

The theory of 'peak oil ' was made a star in 'A Crude Awakening, ' 'The End of Suburbia ' and 'Escape from Suburbia ' , all of which were slow-burning underground hits that are still found showing at cinemas and film clubs long after their original release .

Social issues , particularly in the developing world , have also been documented in recent years .

' Black Gold ' reported on the lives of the impoverished Ethiopian farmers who grow the coffee we enjoy and their search for a fair price .

The next film by Indian director Shekhar Kapur ( who made 'Bandit Queen ' ) is called 'Paani ' , about how the depletion of groundwater in India to slake the thirst of its megacities is causing a loop of famine in rural areas leading to greater migration to the cities .

Of course , the climate change deniers have been busy with their cameras as well .

' The Great Global Warming Swindle ' challenged the scientific consensus that climate change was caused by humanity -- instead arguing that fluctuations in the sun are responsible .

The film was welcomed by skeptics but greeted by a hail of criticism from scientific bodies , including two of the scientists featured in it , Sir David King and Carl Wunsch , who claimed that they had been misrepresented .

British media regulator Ofcom ultimately backed complaints by the men and ruled that part of the film had breached rules on 'due impartiality' .

By far and away the majority support the view that humanity has a role in creating global warming .
But even in the face of potential catastrophe the environmental movement is not without its feel-good hits .

' March of the Penguins ' , which follows a family of penguins across the ice , was a surprise success , in which many felt they had found a philosophical subtext about the importance of family and self-sacrifice .

' Winged Migration ' was a beautifully-shot film showing the immense and incredible journeys undertaken by birds .

David Attenborough 's 'Planet Earth ' series reached new heights with its stunning cinematographic depictions of life on Earth .
Both of these films create a profound feeling of awe of the natural world , underpinned by a sense of its fragility .

While viewers might lose themselves in the beauty of it all , they leave the movies with a creeping sense of what is at stake .

Humans vs. nature : A classic Hollywood theme

But while the market for green documentaries is growing , concern for the environment in film is in some ways nothing new .

Ecology has formed the basis of many Hollywood plots in one way or another for decades , with films like 'Ferngully ' , 'Erin Brockovich ' , 'Silkwood ' and 'Gorillas in the Mist ' all fictionalizing issues around pollution and conservation .

Many of the classic horror films from the 1950 's onwards -- from 'Godzilla ' to 'Return of the Living Dead ' -- featured a plot based on humankind facing the consequences of an arrogant approach to nature .

We 've always felt a link with the natural world and always felt uneasy about our relationship with it , and that 's found expression at the cinema .

But until recently we have n't really engaged with those feelings .
What marks the new generation of films is their seriousness .
They are challenging , inspiring , even .
They ask their audiences not just to react but to act as well and actually make change happen .

Perhaps it is with that message that these often bleak horror films strike a note of real hope .
