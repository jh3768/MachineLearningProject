In 'D.C. Madam's' phone records, a slice of Washington - CNN.com
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Euphemisms abound for prostitution , but spend a week combing through the phone records of the so-called 'D.C .
Madam, ' and it 's clear that 'call girl ' is far and away the most apt .
It is all about the calls .

Deborah Jean Palfrey is a California woman facing federal charges of running an illegal prostitution ring in the Washington area .

She contends it was an escort agency in the most literal sense , and that any eroticism between her escorts and their customers was strictly 'fantasy, ' not hands-on .

That has n't stopped exposed clients Sen. David Vitter , R-Louisiana , from admitting he 'sinned ' and high-ranking State Department official Randall Tobias from resigning for 'personal reasons. '

Which brings us to the phone calls .
As part of her defense strategy , two weeks ago Palfrey published scans of 12 years worth of her escort agency 's phone bills .
The bills do n't detail names -- only phone numbers dialed from Palfrey 's accounts .
Armies of researchers have deployed , doing reverse searches on these numbers in a bid to match them up to the phones ' owners .

When CNN 's Larry King asked Palfrey on Tuesday how many well-known people 's names she expects to turn up , Palfrey responded , 'Well , Larry , I absolutely have no idea .
We estimate statistically there are approximately 20 to 30 to 100 possibilities .
And this is based upon a rough estimate of 10,000 clients who used the service over the past 13 or so years from 1993 to 2006. '

What have CNN 's researchers found so far , apart from five instances of the apologetic Vitter 's number ?
Quite a lot of doctors , actually , and people in the tech industry .
Armchair sociologists will make of that what they will .
Lots of lawyers , too , but of course in Washington it sometimes feels like everyone is a lawyer .
Others run the gamut from the sports world to college professors .

But in many ways , it 's a uniquely Washington picture that emerges .
Noteworthy are the numbers traceable to private properties on Capitol Hill , in neighborhoods heavily populated by 'Hill-types ' ( as they 're known in Beltway jargon ) , be they members of Congress , staffers , or entourage .

Records indicate a handful of numbers have belonged to people working in federal government ; a couple in local politics , and a couple more at government contractors .

' But the thing is , everybody 's somebody in Washington, ' points out Anne Schroeder of The Politico , one of the first Washington journalists to seize on the scandal potential of Palfrey 's case .
' Whether you answer the phone for a senator , or for a lobbyist , or you 're somebody 's daughter 's best friend .
But unless you live here and know everyone , you do n't know who they are. '

The Washington Post makes an appearance .
Was Palfrey contacting a client there ?
Calling in a news tip ?
The extension dialed was the one for placing advertisements in the paper .
A spokesman for the Washington Post continues to investigate at CNN 's request , but so far is unable to determine the nature of the call or whether the Post was one of the publications that ran ads for 'Pamela Martin and Associates. '

Palfrey has said that business was best when Congress was in session , and the phone bills support that .
Of course , that does n't mean the boost in clientele came specifically from representatives and senators .

When Congress is in session the city 's population inflates , buzzing with lobbyists and activists and others who typically drift away when the politicians go home to their constituencies .

' There 's a reason why D.C. is called 'Hollywood for ugly people, ' ' Schroeder says .
' Going out to fancy restaurants , drinking expensive whiskey , living the high life -- lobbyists kind of embody that .
I think it 's a well-known fact , or well presumed , that there are lobbyists who will call a call girl or call an escort service as a part of his business .
It 's not just lobbyists , but they embody that kind of lifestyle , and have that slick , fun air about them. '

Nonetheless , the hefty load of numbers for homes in the leafy suburbs of Maryland and Virginia suggests that Palfrey had a solid base of local clients , too .
In fact , more calls were made to Maryland and Virginia than to numbers with the District of Columbia area code ( 202 ) .

While broad pictures like this are one thing , pointing fingers at clients is quite another .
Documentation and paper trails are usually the jackpot of investigative journalism , but anyone who 's struggled to decipher their own phone bill can begin to appreciate the difficulties of analyzing a four-foot high stack of somebody else 's .

Add to that the fact that a very high proportion of the calls are for cell phone numbers , and it 's not a straightforward puzzle .
Not only are there no comprehensive directories of cell phone numbers , but these numbers also can get recycled through customers so quickly that it can be extremely difficult to determine whose phone it was at the time Palfrey was calling it .

For example , our eyebrows perked up when we came across a cell phone number for a popular local radio host .
After expressing utter amazement that his number featured in the D.C. Madam 's records and denying any connection to her , he initially told CNN that he 'd had that phone number as far back as 2000 or 2001 but he could n't remember the exact date .

The date was crucial .
After calling his cell phone provider to check , the velvety-voiced host reported back that he 'd opened his account in spring 2002 ( the company refused to disclose this to anyone other than the customer ) .
The call to his number was made in January 2001 .

Providing he was telling the truth , he was off the hook .
' At least I 've got a funny story to tell my friends, ' he said .

The numbers can reliably give us insight into Palfrey 's own life , though .
Orchestrating her escort agency from her California home , her typical day began at 8 a.m. From then on it was a telethon until around 11 p.m. , taking and making calls in rapid succession , the occasional break usually lasting no more than 30 to 45 minutes .

The calls themselves were generally short -- under three minutes each .
If nothing else , the record shows that the alleged madam was a hard-working girl .
