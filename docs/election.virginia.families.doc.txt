Families divided as day of reckoning finally arrives - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- On the eve of the U.S. presidential election , CNN.com International speaks to two families from opposite sides of the political divide about their hopes , expectations , concerns and fears for the election and the next four years .

The Armstrongs

Andrea and Richard Armstrong live in Charlottesville , Virginia with their two children , Emma , 12 , and Teddy , 10 .
The couple both work as attorneys and the whole family are enthused at the prospect of an Obama presidency .

' For me the race issue is very important, ' says Andrea .
' He is so representative of the moment .
Here is this man who is black , he grew up in Indonesia and Hawaii .
He is what we need as the face of our nation. '

' I go to school with a lot of friends who are African-American and just for them to see that Obama can be president is good because it shows them anyone can be president, ' says Teddy .

With Americans facing economic uncertainty , Richard believes Obama has the leadership abilities to steer the country to better times .
' He seems like he 's got the persona , the intellect and the stature to make it through what is going to be a very dark period, ' he says .

Although Charlottesville is a prosperous college town , the couple say the effects of the economic crisis are being felt locally .
' A friend just lost his job .
People we know who have businesses are really frightened .
Everything is so stagnant .
There 's a lot of things shutting down, ' says Andrea .

The couple admit they 're 'embarrassed ' by the damage that U.S. foreign policy under President George W. Bush -- particularly the invasion of Iraq -- has done to the reputation of their country .

' Bush has been an embarrassment from the first day and it 's only gotten worse, ' says Andrea .
' When did we become such a laughing stock ?
When did we lose our stature ?
It 's very important how we go forward and represent ourselves in the world .
What a bad reputation we now have. '

The couple would also like to see a universal national healthcare scheme rolled out , with Richard calling the fact that so many Americans lack health insurance 'an outrage in a civilized society. '

' I am shocked by how many people I know who do n't have healthcare, ' says Andrea .
' You ca n't be without healthcare cover in this country .
First of all , because you wo n't get the care you need and second because you 'll just bankrupt yourself. '

Living in a predominantly Democratic neighborhood , the family have been regular volunteers at the local Obama campaign headquarters , making phone calls , recruiting new voters , canvassing and packaging up leaflets .
' It 's meant a lot to us as a family, ' says Andrea .

' Everybody in there is really different but we are all working towards the same thing .
They always seem really happy to see you, ' says Emma .
' They do n't treat you like little kids -- they give you important jobs to do, ' says Teddy .

Andrea has seen a shift among swing voters towards the Democrats during the campaign .
Richard says his father , a moderate Republican who usually votes on national security issues , is even voting for Obama because he dislikes Sarah Palin .

' Right after they picked her and John McCain got that bump ( in the polls ) we just looked at it with dread, ' says Richard .
' But the more people got to know her the more she 's detracted from McCain. '

' How could you take anybody seriously who winks in a debate ?
Somehow she is on the national stage making faces, ' says Andrea .
' They thought women would vote for her just because she is a woman .
That 's not giving the women of America much credit. '

Emma says her classmates at school are mainly Democratic .
' We talk about politics a lot .
My school has about 70 people and out of those people there are about 10 Republicans .
I assume they feel really alienated. '

As a lifelong Democrat , Andrea says it is exciting to see the party 'get its wheels turning properly ' after the election defeats of 2000 and 2004 .

But the couple are taking nothing for granted and admit they are 'scared to death ' by the thought that Obama might not win .
' Everybody who remembers 2000 knows that bad things can happen, ' says Richard .
' It 's just a case of let 's get this one in the bag and get it over with. '

The Pearsons

Jennifer and Sonny Pearson live in Fredericksburg , Virginia , with their two youngest children , Matthew , 17 , and Mary , 15 .
Jennifer is a self-employed tax accountant .
Sonny , a Navy veteran , is studying IT , having previously worked in cable installation .

As an accountant , Jennifer is already seeing the impact of the economic crisis in their blue collar neighborhood .
She fears her business will be hit as clients choose to save money by doing their own tax returns .
Local house prices have fallen by 50 percent and several properties are up for auction .

' It 's the average guys who are affected , not the ones who can go and get a Harvard education, ' she says .
' It 's the guys who can swing a hammer or lay a wire and now they 're losing their businesses and their homes .
It 's terrible. '

The couple fear a Barack Obama presidency will mean steep tax rises for the average family .
They believe tax cuts , and government belt-tightening , are needed to kick start the economy .

' The less you 've got government involved in how people run their lives the better, ' says Sonny .
' I would be willing to put good money on the fact that if Obama gets elected within six months we are going to be in a very deep depression. '

National security is another priority .
' It 's a huge issue, ' says Sonny .
' Bad guys are real , evil exists and they are looking for opportunities. '

They have supported the war effort in Iraq and believe U.S. troops should stay as long as it takes to get the job done -- something they believe John McCain has the leadership skills to achieve -- and fear fresh terrorist attacks on U.S. soil if Obama is elected .

One of the couple 's older children was in high school a mile from the Pentagon on 9/11 so the 'War on Terror ' is an issue close to home they say .

' McCain wants to win in Iraq and get us out of there honorably, ' says Jennifer .
' The American people just need to suck it up and recognize that we 've lost fewer men there in a year than we lost in Vietnam in a day... We 've got men and women going into very dangerous places to get rid of these terrorists and they 're doing it. '

Although concerned by the damage done to the United States ' reputation , they believe national security is more important than popularity .
' Everybody likes to be liked but at the same time I do n't care if somebody does n't like me if it 's going to adversely effect my life and the lives of those people around me, ' says Sonny .

' I think we will get back some respect with McCain .
With Obama we are just going to be destroyed, ' adds Jennifer .

Despite being a cancer survivor , Jennifer and her children have no health insurance .
As a Navy veteran , Sonny 's medical bills have been covered by a veterans ' scheme since he required brain surgery for a double aneurysm .

' I do n't want socialised medicine because I know too many people who 've come here from Canada to get fixed because they ca n't get the service, ' says Jennifer .
' I had insurance when I had cancer and I can not tell you how many thousands of dollars we spent. '

As a working mother , Jennifer respects Sarah Palin and has no qualms about her qualifications to be vice-president .
' First of all , she raised five kids and that 's hard, ' she says .
' She 's got better credentials than Obama .
It makes no sense to me that people are down on her for being a woman. '

The family are suspicious of Obama , believing he has promised far more than he can deliver .
' You ca n't promise magic if you do n't have a wand, ' says Sonny .
' And he 's got nothing to work with unless he levies some heavy taxes on everyone. '

' It would be better for Obama to be an actor than a president because he just wants the fame, ' adds Mary .

At school , Matthew admits it 's tough being a Republican .
' People make a lot of jokes about the Republican Party and so everyone just ends up being liberal, ' he says .
' I 've been getting into arguments with entire classes. '
