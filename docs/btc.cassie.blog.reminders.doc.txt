Cassie will be meeting and helping children from the region who have suffered from a range of afflictions .

November 13 , 2007 As I 've been getting to know my neighbors better , I 've slowly begun to piece together more about their personal histories .

One of my neighbors is a kind woman who enjoys talking with me in a broken Khmer/English exchange .
She lives in a house with her children and husband .
However , I 've noticed that she does not speak or interact with her husband .
In fact , she told me she does n't talk to him at all any more and that he 's taken another wife in another province .
Not wanting to pry , I 've never asked why .

One afternoon , my friend came to visit .
She showed my neighbor and me the traditional Khmer photos she recently had done at one of the many costume and photography shops in town .

Normally , Khmer have this type of photography done when they are getting married or for other special occasions .
At the shop they dress you up from head to toe in gowns , wedding dresses or whatever traditional style clothing you want , complete with jewelry and makeup .
Then , through the magic of Photoshop , you can be inserted into any background scene you desire .
All in all , it makes for some sa-aat nah ( very beautiful ) photographs .

As we were looking over the photos , my neighbor suggested I should go to get some taken .
The photos clearly impressed her , so I asked her why she did n't have any of her wedding .
She explained there were no photos taken at her wedding and naturally I asked why not .
Instantly the smile on her face faded and in a serious tone , she recounted her wedding as just a handshake in a group of 15 couples .
Grim smiles were on everyone 's faces as I realized she had had a forced marriage under the Khmer Rouge .

Within a 10-second period , what had been a light-hearted conversation filled with laughter became a serious and uncomfortable silence haunted by memories .

Though it 's not often discussed , the Khmer Rouge explains so much about the current cultural reality .
Families were systematically separated for purposes of control and domination , and many young people were forced into assigned marriages where they would wed , en masse , with the shake of a hand .

I realized that the man my neighbor calls her husband was nothing more than a stranger she was forced to marry some 28 years ago .
They had children and became a family , so they still live together , but their history explains a lot about why things have not worked out between the two of them .

My neighbor 's story is a not-so-subtle reminder that the legacy of the Khmer Rouge still touches every aspect of the Cambodia I experience today .

When I came to Cambodia I did n't know what to expect with regard to the impact of the Khmer Rouge .
However , I did anticipate a noticeable and disproportionate population distribution between generations , given that approximately one quarter of the population was killed during the regime .
But I was surprised at the number of older people I saw and realized that I had misjudged how small 25 percent of the population would have been .

In my first weeks here , whenever I saw someone who looked over the age of 40 , I would reflect about what they might have experienced during the war as I studied the creases in their faces .

As a tourist , it is difficult to lose sight of the ubiquitous memory of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia .
Whether it 's visiting the many killing fields and shrines throughout the country , spotting frequent prosthetic limbs , or seeing people sell memoirs and novels detailing Khmer Rouge atrocities at tourist hot spots , it is never too long before the next reminder .
Indeed , it is difficult to ignore any part of this history and reality of Cambodia .

However , as an expatriate living in this country , the history and relevance of the Khmer Rouge is not as prominent on a daily basis .
At times it is easy to neglect this past as one of the major forces shaping the status quo .

But it seems that every time I lose pulse of the implications of the war , a story or place will revive my understanding that the Khmer Rouge is far from history in Cambodia -- it lives on in the hearts and faces of all who survived .
