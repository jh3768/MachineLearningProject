Skirting the shore in Maine - CNN.com
( Coastal Living ) -- Penobscot Bay may be one of the world 's great cruising grounds for sailors , but you do n't need a mast to fall under its watery spell .
Kayakers love it , too .
Ancient glaciers sculpted the big bay 's granite coast , creating countless inlets and coves to explore .
The setting offers snug harbor towns and inviting inns , many an easy paddle apart .
Throw in the world 's tastiest lobster and you have all the ingredients for a self-propelled trip that 's more relaxing than taxing .

To chart a course with comfortable distances , sheltered passages and seaside inns where one can walk to dinner , I consulted Hot Showers ! , a lodging guide for Maine 's water-borne travelers .
The result ?
An appealing route northward from Tenants Harbor to South Thomaston .
Hard-core kayakers might scoff at my four-night/three-day itinerary , which requires only two to four hours of paddling per day .
But it allows plenty of time for additional meandering on the water and lounging ashore .
And I 'm traveling with my girlfriend , a woman who looks at the ribbed skirt kayakers use to seal the cockpit and immediately thinks of French designer Jean Paul Gaultier .
Mindful that they call tandem kayaks 'divorce boats, ' I aim to avoid mutiny .

But tandems do offer physical stability -- a key factor given the bay 's frigid water .
Not complete novices , we embark equipped with life jackets , spare paddle , chart and compass , a hand pump for bailing , rain gear and layers of quick-drying clothing ( synthetics trump cotton ) .
And we meet a friendly group of local paddlers who offer guidance .
' Our tides are strong, ' explains one .
' In good weather , 3 miles per hour is considered normal speed , but going against the tide can cut that by half. '

So 'time and tide wait for no man ' becomes our motto .
We hit the water an hour or two after low tide ( not terribly early , as it happens ) to catch the rising waters that -- along with the prevailing winds from the southwest -- will aid our progress .
Early on we get a lesson on the Zen of paddling from Beezie Clarke , an avid kayaker in her 70s .
' Think in terms of pushing the water past the boat, ' she says .
' I used to try to paddle fast , then I realized it 's better to keep up a slow and steady rhythm .

Besides , hurrying means less time to chat with fellow paddlers and admire the unspooling backdrop of evergreen forest , picturesque ports and vintage houses .
We encounter plenty of other vessels -- graceful sailboats , weathered runabouts , and , of course , lobster boats .
With their spacious , low-slung sterns and bows that sweep up to plow the swells , these broad-beamed craft are functional and intimidating .
' You know what lobstermen call kayakers ?
' asks Bob MacLaughlin , a seasoned Penobscot paddler .
''Speedbumps. ' I always figure they ca n't see us , so I give them the right of way. '

Kayaking 's sea-level intimacy and relative quiet ( especially when we pause our paddles ) bring nature into sharper focus .
Harbor seals stick their heads up to check us out .
Cormorants perch on seaweed-draped boulders , drying their wings in the breeze .
We also spot many species of lobster buoys , each marking the owner of the trap below with a colorful pattern , a waterman 's semaphore .

Inspired , we take advantage of several paddle-up restaurants -- we call them 'float-ins ' -- where you can beach or tie up your boat and moments later dig into a lobster just plucked from the bay .
We lunch or dine at Cod End , Miller 's Lobster Company and Waterman 's Beach Lobster , which has won a James Beard 'Classics ' award .
All three supply a definitive Maine experience .
Everything 's made fresh daily , including the pies .
( Take my advice : Order the blueberry for lunch , because it 'll be gone by dinnertime .

At the end of each day 's paddling we haul our boat above the high-tide line and head for one of those hot showers .
After dressing in clothes pulled from our watertight bags , we go to dinner .
At the East Wind Inn and the Craignair Inn , that means simply walking downstairs to a hotel dining room .
The next night , at the Blue Lupin B&amp ; B , it 's an easy stroll to Waterman 's Beach Lobster ( I scheduled the trip to avoid their Monday and Tuesday closing ) .
And our last lodging , the Weskeag Inn , is only steps from a general store/diner with homestyle food , a good place to hear banter with a Downeast accent .
The accommodations are cozy but not fancy , and all serve breakfast .

The Weskeag Inn overlooks the Weskeag River -- really more of a long tidal basin whose water funnels forcefully under a bridge .
The only way to paddle through is on a rising tide ( ideally , within three hours of high tide ) , when the usual outflow ebbs and reverses .
We do just that , managing the still-tricky current with a flurry of fast , strong strokes that thrusts our boat past the rapids and into a calm side eddy .

It 's a spirited finale to our journey .
Far from sowing conflict , our shared adventure fosters conversation , teamwork and a sense of well-being .
Gray Smith , our host at the Weskeag Inn , gives us a ride back to our car .
We 're surprised at how little time it takes to retrace our steps from South Thomaston to Tenants Harbor , a distance of about 10 miles .
But as our kayaking voyage proves , the best way from point A to point B is not always the shortest .
