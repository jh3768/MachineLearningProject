Pedro's predictions - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- Euro 2008 is upon us and all the talk about who will win and who will be the star of the tournament has begun .
Everyone seems to have an opinion , so why ca n't I ?

To be honest , I am really looking forward to this tournament .
It is so open that one could say at least half of the teams could capture the crown !

Especially after what happened four years ago with Greece lifting the trophy , who could count out teams like Croatia and Poland ?
Hey... anything is possible , right ?
Otto Rehaggel has even said that lightning could strike twice , alluding that his side could yet make another title run !

But back to my opinions .
Here is an overview of what I expect to be the headlines of Euro 2008 :

France fail to qualify for knock out stage :

Les Bleus are in the so called 'Group of Death ' and in my opinion they will not be able to survive .
They had an unexpected run to the final of the World Cup two years ago , but without Zinedine Zidane , there will be no repeat of such a performance .
They will struggle to score goals , and finish third in the group behind the Netherlands and Italy .
Do you agree with Pedro ?
Have your say below

Co-hosts bounced out early :

OK , this is n't exactly revolutionary insight , but in my opinion , neither Switzerland nor Austria will make it past the group phase .
The Swiss have shown signs of quality in warm-up games , but their squad is still not strong enough to finish ahead of Portugal or the Czech Republic in Group A. And then there is Turkey , who are also tough opponents .
I see them finishing last in the group .
As far as Austria is concerned , the outlook is equally bleak .
With only three wins in their last 15 games heading into the tournament , they will really struggle to register any points in a group featuring Germany , Croatia and Poland .
Maybe a draw against the Poles is possible , but I do n't see them making it into the quarterfinals .

No Euro crown for world champions : Winning the World Cup and European Championships back to back is no easy feat .
France did it in 98 and 2000 , Italy wo n't .
The Azzurri are getting increasingly old and especially in defense they will struggle to keep up with teams who possess fast forwards .
Andrea Pirlo and Gennaro Gattuso are still influential in midfield , but the loss of Fabio Cannavaro is a big blow and Francesco Totti is no longer around .
Luca Toni will score a few goals , but I ca n't see Italy having enough depth to make it all the way to the final .

Germany reign supreme :

It 's no coincidence the bookies have made Germany the favorites .
This team has been growing into a formidable force and has reached the point of maturity necessary to win a major title .
After narrowly missing out on the World Cup crown , players like Michael Ballack , Torsten Frings and Miroslav Klose are at the right time in their careers to deliver on the biggest stage .
Ballack should be especially influential considering he missed the first half of last season and has fresher legs than many of midfield opponents .
He was Chelsea 's best player in the last month of the Premier League season .
My final prediction ?
Germany beats the Netherlands in the final 2-1 !

So there you have it .
My last words are about Portugal , my native country .
I would like to believe they could win it , but they still lack a top quality forward to finish all the chances their midfielders and wingers create .
And Cristiano Ronaldo ca n't win all of the games on his own -- even if he is the best player on the planet !
