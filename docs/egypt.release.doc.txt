Egypt releases jailed opposition leader - CNN.com
CAIRO , Egypt ( CNN ) -- The Egyptian government has unexpectedly released one of the country 's most prominent dissidents , Ayman Nour , who was jailed more than three years ago despite widespread national and international objections .

Eight other dissidents and Nour , head of al-Ghad Party , were released Wednesday for health reasons , according to a member of his party and to Egyptian state-run media .

Government-owned al-Ahram newspaper reported that the decisions were made based on a medical committee 's report .

Wearing a black suit and an orange tie , Nour -- an insulin-requiring diabetic who also has a heart condition -- told reporters that his release 'was a complete surprise. '

He said he was put into a car but was not told he was about to be driven to his home .

' Only halfway through the ride did I know where I was going, ' he said , adding that authorities had not discussed his release with him nor was he aware that anyone might have negotiated on his behalf .

In September 2005 , Nour placed a distant second to President Hosni Mubarak in Egypt 's first contested presidential race .
In previous elections , Mubarak had been the sole candidate nominated by parliament , and voters could only cast yea or nay ballots .

Months after the election , Nour was sentenced to a five-year prison term for a forgery conviction -- a move criticized by his supporters as trumped up and politically motivated .

At the time , the Bush administration expressed concern , saying his imprisonment 'calls into question Egypt 's commitment to democracy , freedom , and the rule of law. '

Nour , who spent most of Wednesday in interviews , told reporters he hopes his release 'is a conciliatory step towards a national dialogue for a better Egypt. '

But his wife Gamila Ismail , who campaigned tirelessly for his release , was more cautious .

' You can never tell what is going to happen in the next minute, ' she told CNN in a telephone interview .
' You can not even say that he is going to be free forever. '

Despite her happiness over his release , 'I really wish that what happened with God 's will today would happen to thousands and thousands of other [ jailed ] people who are suffering in this country, ' she said .

Ismail said she learned about Nour 's release when her housekeeper called her at work and told her that he was at the door and had no key .
When she arrived 15 minutes later , 'my kids had opened the door and I found him praying. '

Ismail said she believes his release was politically motivated .

Nour told reporters he felt the same way .
' I have no proof , though , but I expect that there are political signs which led to the decision .
Or some political authority that called for it. '

Some analysts speculate that Mubarak released Nour as a gesture of goodwill toward U.S. President Barack Obama , whose call for change Nour supported last year in a letter to the candidate , according to Egyptian news reports , including those of government-run outlets .

Mubarak has not visited the United States since 2003 , when tensions heightened between Cairo and the Bush administration over the Iraq war .

Since the 1980s , Cairo has received about $ 2 billion per year in U.S. aid , including about $ 1.3 billion in military assistance and services .

Last year , Congress for the first time put conditions on the aid -- demanding it be withheld until Cairo implemented judicial reforms and curbed human-rights violations .
But then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice waived the restrictions .

Since last month , Egyptian government-run news media have been reporting that Mubarak plans to visit Washington in April 'to congratulate the new U.S .
president.'

Though Nour has been banned from seeking political office again , he spoke Wednesday of 'rebuilding ' his al-Ghad Party .

His wife was not enthusiastic .

' I am not sure if he knows how serious the situation is now, ' she said , adding that she was afraid such efforts could result in him being sent back to prison .

Neither Nour nor Ismail expressed gratitude to the Egyptian regime for his release .

' Whoever released my husband is the reason he stayed in jail for three and half years, ' Ismail said .
' So I do not and I can not have gratitude whatsoever for someone who harmed him , us and everyone around us and suddenly decided to be nice. '
