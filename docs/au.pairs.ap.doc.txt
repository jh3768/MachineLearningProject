More parents importing child care - CNN.com
NEW YORK ( AP ) -- The welcome sign was ready , so were the balloons .
It was as though the DaRossos were greeting a newfound family member , and in a way , they were .

The Ecuadoran woman arriving that spring day was the Yonkers family 's seventh au pair -- part of a growing corps of au pairs in a country clamoring for child care and often struggling to find it outside traditional work and school hours .

With au pairs ' numbers up more than 86 percent nationwide in the last decade -- nearing 22,000 last year -- the State Department is considering raising the age limit from 26 to 30 and letting some former participants return for another year .
Many were limited to one-year stints before the United States began allowing two-year stays in 2004 .

Together , the measures could expand the pool of au pairs by up to 40 percent , said Geoff Watson , who runs San Francisco-based AuPairCare .
It 's unclear when a decision might come or what opposition the proposals may face ; the State Department is processing a May 7 request to see comments submitted about the plan .

Au pairs are young foreigners allowed to provide live-in child care and take classes for up to two years -- unlike nannies , who generally are already in the United States and caring for children as a career .
Under State Department rules , au pairs work up to 45 hours a week .
The aides , who must be at least 18 , get room , board , and stipends .

The French name and globe-trotting nature might give it a rarified image , but many families say they hire au pairs for down-to-earth reasons : flexible hours , relative affordability , convenience and individual attention .

Fans also praise the arrangement 's internationalism and familial feel .
An au pair can be a combination big sister or brother , cultural ambassador and foreign-language tutor -- all before breakfast .

Marisol Lopez-DaRosso and her husband have hired au pairs from countries as distant as Brazil and Slovakia , getting genial supervision for their sons , 8 and 9 , and peace of mind for their parents .

Having 'someone at home is a comfort , at least for me and my husband -- someone that we can trust, ' said Lopez-DaRosso .

The program is not without its skeptics .
Au pair Louise Woodward 's widely publicized manslaughter conviction in the 1997 shaking death of a Massachusetts infant ignited anxieties about au pairs ' screening and training .
That prompted changes such as requirements for psychological evaluation and more rigorous preparation , but proponents of day care centers and more formally trained nannies say they often offer more education and oversight .

Launched in 1986 , the au pair program is intended as both cultural exchange and child care .
' Au pair ' means 'on par with, ' signifying the helpers ' status as equals in the household .

Au pairs ' ranks have grown as the number of U.S. preschoolers with working mothers rose nearly 40 percent between 1985 and 2005 , to more than 11.3 million , according to Census Bureau figures .

Costs for an au pair total about $ 300 weekly -- hardly cheap , but not extravagant when day care programs average about $ 175 per week , per child , according to the National Association for the Education of Young Children .
It 's also more affordable than a nanny , who can easily command $ 600 for a 45-hour week , said Jean Mason Knaak , the founder of Minneapolis-based Nanny Professionals .

Au pair Saori Hayakawa has brought a bit of her native Japan to Kim and Brian Roemer 's Detroit-area home , teaching the three kids under 7 some Japanese , showing them origami and getting them to try eating seaweed .

Meanwhile , the 27-year-old Hayakawa has polished her English , joined a barbershop quartet and taken her own parents to Niagara Falls .
The former Tokyo office worker chose an au pair job over a study-abroad program because 'I wanted to see the culture , and I wanted to see a traditional family, ' she said .

Not all au pair pairings are happy ones , and the consequences can be far more serious than spats over international phone bills .
The program 's reputation took a grave hit from the Woodward case , which spurred soul-searching on editorial pages and around kitchen tables about the wisdom of entrusting children to young visitors with limited training .

The au pair program survived , but with a new requirement for psychological screening and stiffer experience and training standards for those working with children under 2 .

If anyone qualifies as an expert on au pairs , it 's Kara Hart .
The 12-year-old daughter of a pediatric emergency room doctor and a park service officer in Napa , California , can chart almost her entire childhood with au pairs .
Her collages commemorate each aide ; a world map sprouts thumb tacks tracing their homelands across three continents .

' They 've really changed my life, ' she says .
' I 've learned a lot about different places. '
