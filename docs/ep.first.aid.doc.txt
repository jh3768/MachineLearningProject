Five simple ways to save a life  - CNN.com
ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) -- Quick : What would you do if you impaled yourself with a large , sharp , piece of wood ?
If your tooth fell out ?
If you fell from a high ladder ?
If your friend had a severe allergic reaction ?

Even if you do n't have first aid training , there are simple things everyone can learn to do in emergency situations .
' You really could save somebody 's life, ' says Dr. Assaad Sayah , chief of emergency medicine at the Cambridge Health Alliance in Massachusetts .

Think of it as 'first aid for idiots ' -- five things to remember if you otherwise know nothing about first aid .

Do n't remove a foreign object .

It happens more often than you might think : a child impaled by a pencil or someone stepping on a nail or even someone being stabbed .
Particularly after storms , debris is also an impalement hazard .
Among injuries that cause ER visits , punctures rank fourth behind falls , car accidents and being struck by an object , according to the CDC .

The doctor 's advice : Leave it in and call 911 ( unless it 's something small , like a splinter ) .

' It may be plugging a hole in an artery or vein , and as soon as you take it out , you could bleed to death, ' says Dr. David Beiser , an emergency medicine physician at the University of Chicago Medical Center .

Do n't apply a tourniquet to stop bleeding .

Apply pressure and do n't put on a tourniquet unless you 've been trained to do so .

' If you do n't know what you 're doing , you could destroy that limb, ' Sayah says .

Do ask around for an epi pen in case of allergic reaction .

If someone has an allergic reaction , ask if he or she has an epinephrine pen .
They may have one but forgotten .
' People get very panicked when they ca n't breathe, ' Sayah says .
' If they do n't have one , ask other people who might be nearby. '

Sayah says epi pens are easy to use even without training .
' It 's like a ballpoint pen that clicks, ' he says .
And of course , call 911 .

Do n't clean a tooth that 's fallen out .

' You 're cleaning off important structures like nerves and ligaments, ' Beiser says .

Put the tooth in milk and head to the emergency room , says Dr. Richard Bradley , a member of the American Red Cross advisory council on first aid , aquatics , safety and preparedness .

As an alternative , you can try to hold it in the socket where it fell out , he says , adding that if a child loses a baby tooth , doctors will not try to put it back in -- it 's gone for good .

Do n't move someone who 's fallen from a high place .

Anyone who 's fallen from an elevation is at risk of sprains , fractures and worse , internal injuries .

' If they 're in back or neck pain , leave them in the position they 're in, ' Bradley says .
' If you need to move them , do a log roll so you 're moving their head , body , and legs all as one unit. '
