Man City smash transfer record to sign Jo - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- Manchester City have confirmed the signing of Brazilian striker Jo from CSKA Moscow for a club record undisclosed fee -- believed to be in the region of $ 37 million .

The 21-year-old forward , who has been capped once by Brazil , has signed a four-year contract .

Jo had been on the verge of moving to the Premier League club for a number of weeks and becomes Mark Hughes ' first signing since replacing Sven-Goran Eriksson .

Jo , full name Joao Alves de Assis Silva , is a skilful left-footed striker who joined several compatriots at CSKA in 2005 when he moved from Corinthians .

He scored 44 goals in 77 games for CSKA , helping them to two Russian Super Cups , the Russian Premier League title in 2006 along with the Russian Cup in the same season .

' I decided to come to Manchester City because it is one of the clubs who showed more interest in me , although I had other offers as well, ' Jo said at a press conference announcing his signing .

' After I spoke to the manager , I was very pleased .
I was told Manchester City is a club going forward at the moment .
We can go places , that is our objective .
We thought about it and I decided to come to Manchester City for that reason. '

Jo added Valencia were City 's main rivals for his signature .
' The club who showed interest officially was Valencia, ' he said .
' I know from the press there were other clubs who showed an interest. '

Hughes said : 'He is a big talent and a young man with a big future .
A lot has been said about him and there was a big expectation on him coming out of Brazil .

' So with the success he 's had I think it 's a real coup that we 've been able to bring him to the club .
' He is a big guy , in stature and in ability , so I think everybody will enjoy watching him play. '

Hughes also spoke of the possibility of Jo 's compatriot Ronaldinho moving to the club as well .
The forward has been told he can leave Barcelona but has yet to actually leave the Nou Camp , with AC Milan , Chelsea and City being linked with a move .
' Basically that 's a process that is ongoing, ' Hughes said .
' I do n't think the process has slowed or accelerated. '

Hughes admitted the media speculation has been somewhat unhelpful but revealed one-to-one talks have been positive .
' He 's a huge world star and these things , if they are going to happen , are likely to take a bit of time, ' he added .

' In the discussions he 's had with the club I think he 's been very positive about the idea of coming here. '

As one player moves to Eastlands , another departs , after City 's Swedish international goalkeeper Andreas Isaksson completed his move to PSV Eindhoven .

Isaksson found first-team opportunities limited last season as young Englishman Joe Hart established himself under Eriksson .

The 26-year-old has sined a four-year contract for an undisclosed fee and will replace Brazilian Heurelho Gomes , who is poised to join Tottenham .
