Rock joins trio in lead with late surge - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- England 's Robert Rock charged to five birdies in his last six holes to claim a share of the lead at the Alfred Dunhill Championship in South Africa on Friday .

Rock joined co-overnight leader Len Mattiace of the United States and Oskar Henningson of Sweden on 11-under 133 at halfway in the European/Sunshine Tour event .

Henningsson carded a 64 , the best round of the tournament at Leopard Creek this week .

Current Sunshine Tour Order of Merit leader Richard Sterne , one of the most promising talents in the South African game , had set the earlier pace with his six-under-par round of 66 leaving him one shot behind the trio in the lead .

A bunch of five players are clustered on nine-under , including 2004 winner Charl Schwartzel , while the top-ranked player in the field , England 's Lee Westwood , is handily placed in a three-strong group on eight under .

Sterne -- winner of four European Tour titles -- looked set to take the overall lead as he compiled an eagle and four birdies , but a triple bogey on the par-five 18th halted his charge .

' It was quite a special round , obviously, ' he told the Press Association .

' I had a little hiccup somewhere but it was all pretty good , pretty decent .
I was never really in trouble. '

Fellow South African and world number 30 , Rory Sabbatini , also looked set to feature , but dropped two late shots to slip to six-under .

Northern Ireland 's promising Rory McIlroy , who came close to victory in the Hong Kong Open , missed the cut by a stroke on 143 , but another former amateur star , England 's Chris Wood , is in contention on five-under .

Wood finished fifth at British Open at Royal Birkdale while still an amateur , turning to the pro ranks shortly afterwards .
