CNN Student News Learning Activities: Black History Month - CNN.com
Use these activities to encourage your students to learn about and appreciate the history , culture and achievements of African-Americans .

A Milestone in U.S. History

Remind students that they recently witnessed a truly historical event : the inauguration of Barack Obama as the first African-American U.S. president. Ask students : What will you remember most about this milestone ?
What do you want future generations to know about it ?
Challenge students to write letters to future young Americans , describing President Obama 's inauguration and its significance for all Americans .
Combine the letters into a book or create a video of students reading their letters .
Present the book or recording to your school 's historian or media specialist for archiving .

Covering Black History

Ask students : What if CNN correspondents had been on the scene to record key moments in black history for the entire world to see ?
Organize students into small teams of reporters , and have each team select a time period in American history and a key figure or event that helped to define that time period for African-Americans .
Then , have students imagine that CNN was there to cover the historical figure or event .
Ask : How do you think that CNN reporters might have covered these stories ?
For example , reporters might have conducted interviews , gathered footage of key events , produced stories on the events or people or had newsmakers as guests on live programs .
Encourage the teams to write scripts for news stories on their historical figures and events .
After students have presented their scripts , have them compare their reports to eyewitness accounts and local newspaper reports that were written at the time .

Harlem Renaissance

Inform students that during the 1920s and 1930s , an African-American cultural movement occurred in the United States that was known as the Harlem Renaissance .
It was a literary , musical and artistic explosion that was born in Harlem , New York , and it had a profound impact on African-American culture and on the U.S. as a whole .
Have your class host a Harlem Renaissance cultural fair .
Direct students to online resources to learn about some of the great artists , writers and musicians who were part of the renaissance and their contributions to this cultural movement .
Some of these individuals include :

& # 8226 ; Marian Anderson

& # 8226 ; Countee Cullen

Have each student select one of these African-American artists and design a display that tells about the life and times of the artist and the importance of his or her work .
Invite guests from your school and community to attend the exhibit .
Have students serve as 'roaming curators ' to instruct and interest guests in the Harlem Renaissance and the creative works of these great African-Americans .

Profiles in Black History

Do your students show a personal interest in science , music , politics , theater , sports or education ?
Inspire them to celebrate the contributions of African-Americans by having them write profiles of African-Americans in the categories that interest them .
For example , a budding young scientist might choose to profile the inventor of the ironing board , the lawn mower or the space shuttle retrieval arm , all of whom were/are African-Americans .
Direct your students to online and print resources , and have them conduct research on their chosen individuals .
Then , encourage students to write proposals to have their selected persons commemorated in new postage stamps .
Students should accompany their proposals with designs for the stamps .
In their presentations , students should try to convince classmates why their profiled persons should have a stamp created in their name .
Post the designs around the classroom .

Local African-American History

Valuable lessons in black history may be found just a few steps away in the stories and documents that can be found in local libraries , historical organizations , universities or colleges and online .
Encourage students to venture out into the community to investigate the history and contributions of black Americans in their city or town .
Students might choose to use milestones in black history as a way to organize their research , gathering information on how those events impacted the community and its residents .
They may also decide to profile influential black community members .
Have students invite community members to a celebration of local black history .

Black History Museum

Celebrate black history by creating plans for a local Black History Museum .
First , have students decide where the museum should be housed .
Suggestions might include a school or local library , an exhibit in an existing history museum or perhaps a virtual online museum .
Next , discuss how the museum should be organized .
Students may choose to categorize the content by theme , by specific time periods , by specific dates , by people or by local landmarks .
Then , challenge students to consider what people , events or contributions to include in their Black History Museum .
Ask : Will the museum be interactive ?
Will it offer multimedia elements ?
What messages or lessons do you want visitors to take away from the exhibits ?

Not Just for February

Inform students that , while Dr. Carter G. Woodson chose the month of February to recognize the accomplishments of African-Americans , black history can be celebrated all year long .
Challenge students to create year-long calendars or timelines that highlight the contributions of African-American newsmakers , illustrate key events in black history and encourage an ongoing celebration of black culture .
