All-American team to join F1 grid next year - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- An all-American team is set to enter Formula One in 2010 -- bucking the global economic downturn which has forced motorsport 's elite category to introduce a series of cost-cutting measures .

While established teams such as Honda are struggling to survive , proposals for the new line-up were revealed in a broadcast on Speed TV in the United States .

The proposed USF1 team is the brainchild of sporting director Peter Windsor and former F1 designer Ken Anderson , who have ambitious plans to join the grid in less than 12 months time .

Rumors of the proposed driver line-up have linked female Indy Car star Danica Patrick and NASCAR 's Kyle Busch , with Scott Speed and Marco Andretti also mentioned .

The team will be based in North Carolina , the heartland of the NASCAR stock car series , but have still to finalize an engine supplier and confirm sponsors .

' When we realized that the technology was here and with the help of the new FIA regulations -- that were made for new teams to come into the sport -- we thought we could do a team here in the United States and that it was going to be a car made in America, ' Windsor told Speed TV .

' The logical thing then from a marketing perspective was to see if we can have two American drivers .
And that is indeed what we intend to do. '

Windsor added that they had the backing of Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone who told him 'great , get it done. '

The USF1 team is expected to have a budget of roughly $ 60 million per year , but their anticipated arrival comes at a time when F1 does not have a race in the United States and Canada and with no drivers from North America .

The possible loss of Honda from the 2009 grid prompted world governing body the FIA to introduce a series of measures to make it cheaper to run a team in the world championship .

Windsor sees this as a major opportunity : 'Long before the current economic recession , we were thinking 'lean , mean', ' he said .

' We were questioning why the existing F1 teams needed to spend hundreds of millions of dollars in not winning races ; and we were convinced that not only could an F1 be designed and built in the USA but also that we could base the team in America , too. '

The new 2009 F1 season starts in Australia on March 29 .

Meanwhile , troubled bank Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS ) will end its sponsorship of Formula One team Williams as a result of the economic downturn .

The announcement comes on the eve of a new low in business when RBS will mark the biggest ever loss in British corporate history .
