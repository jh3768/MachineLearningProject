Five ways to avoid germs while traveling - CNN.com
ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) -- This week while you 're traveling , if you happen to spot a man applying hand sanitizer as he gets off an escalator , there 's a good chance it 's Dr. Mark Gendreau , a senior staff physician at the Lahey Clinic in Burlington , Massachusetts .

Gendreau studies germiness while traveling , and he knows just how infectious travel can be .

' The risk of contracting a contagious illness is heightened when we travel within any enclosed space , especially during the winter months , when most of the respiratory viruses thrive, ' Gendreau said .

Studies show that germs can travel easily on an airplane , where people are packed together like sardines .

For example , a woman on a 1994 flight from Chicago to Honolulu transmitted drug-resistant tuberculosis to at least six of her fellow passengers , according to a New England Journal of Medicine study .

In 2003 , 22 people came down with SARS , or severe acute respiratory syndrome , from a single fellow passenger who had SARS but did n't have any symptoms , according to another New England journal study .

But the airplane is n't the only place along your travel route where germs thrive .
Here are five ways to avoid germs while traveling .

Sit toward the front of the airplane

' Pick a seat near the front , since ventilation systems on most commercial aircraft provide better air flow in the front of the aircraft, ' Gendreau advised .
If you can afford it , sit in first class , where people are n't so squished together .

Do n't drink coffee or tea on an airplane

Monitoring by the Environmental Protection Agency shows that water in airplanes ' water tanks is n't always clean -- and coffee and tea are usually made from that water , not from bottled water , according to Victoria Day , a spokeswoman for the Air Transport Association .

The EPA advises anyone with a suppressed immune system or anyone who 's 'concerned ' about bacteria to refrain from drinking coffee or tea on an airplane .

' While boiling water for one minute will remove pathogens from drinking water , the water used to prepare coffee and tea aboard a plane is not generally brought to a sufficiently high temperature to guarantee that pathogens are killed, ' according to the EPA 's Web site .

According to the EPA , out of 7,812 water samples taken from 2,316 aircraft , 2.8 percent were positive for coliform bacteria .
Although that sounds like a small number , this means 222 samples contained coliform bacteria .

Sanitize your hands after leaving an airplane bathroom

A toilet on an airplane 'is among the germiest that you will encounter almost anywhere, ' said Charles Gerba , an environmental microbiologist at the University of Arizona who 's also known as 'Dr .
Germ.'

' You have 50 people per toilet , unless you are flying a discount airline ; then it is 75, ' Gerba said .
' We always find E. coli on surfaces in airplane restrooms. '

You should wash your hands after using the restroom , but because the water itself might have harmful bacteria ( see No .
2 above ) and because the door handle on your way out has been touched by all those who went before you , Gendreau also advises sanitizing your hands when you return to your seat .

Wash or sanitize your hands after getting off an escalator

Gendreau says tests show that escalators in airports are full of germs .

To confirm these tests , here 's a fun activity while you wait for your flight this Thanksgiving : Look at your watch , and count how many people get an escalator in a five-minute time period .
Multiply that by 12 , and you have how many people are on that escalator every hour .

High-volume handrails are why Gendreau sanitizes his hands as soon as he can after he exits an escalator .

Wash or sanitize your hands after using an ATM

Gendreau says ATMs , especially in busy places like airports , are full of germs .
As with escalators , he sanitizes ASAP after using one .

Gendreau says that keeping healthy while traveling can be summed up in six words : 'hand hygiene , hand hygiene , hand hygiene. '

Keeping your hands clean is crucial , he says , when you 're spending the day touching surfaces that have been touched by hundreds or thousands of people before you .
