Three-wheeled racer - CNN.com
( PopSci.com ) -- Talk about a dream job .
A handful of lucky engineers just outside Paris earn their euros creating wild concept cars for Peugeot , and their only imperative is to advance the state of automotive design .

While dreaming up their latest project , they hit upon a radical way to skim weight : ditch the vehicle 's rear end .
Specifically , they eliminated one of the wheels and all the accompanying components , including suspension , brakes , and the actual body around it .

The result , dubbed the 20Cup ( 'two-oh cup ' ) , is a 1,279-pound three-wheeler that carries just 20 percent of its weight in the rear .

This arrangement actually gives the car better cornering grip than any production vehicle .
And although the three-wheeled setup wo n't make it to the showroom , the aerodynamic shape and 154-pound carbon-fiber chassis could influence future vehicles .

Its petite engine does n't crank out racecar power , but given the 20Cup 's weight -- about 700 pounds less than the famously lightweight Lotus Elise -- speed is not a problem .

The 20Cup has a better power-to-weight ratio than the street rocket Porsche 911 Carrera S. In preliminary tests it hit 62 mph in 5.2 seconds , which Peugeot says is n't close to demonstrating the car 's true performance .

So is there a three-wheeler in your future ?
Not likely .
Removing all that weight from the rear makes for an unusual driving experience ; the 20Cup can spin like a top around its front end .
That 's great for taking sharp turns , but only once you know what you 're doing .

' You basically have to learn a new way to drive to make it around a corner safely, ' says chief designer Jean-Christophe Bolle-Reddat , one of the few people who have driven the 20Cup -- and , for that matter , one of the lucky few who ever will .
