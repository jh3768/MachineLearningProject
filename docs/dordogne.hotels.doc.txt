Secret hotels of the Dordogne - CNN.com
( Budget Travel ) -- The Dordogne River valley is one of the most beautiful areas in France -- and there are plenty of stylish hotels where even a weak dollar goes far .

MONTIGNAC

Le Bellevue

Overlooking umpteen miles of rolling hills and the tiny town of Montignac , these basic accommodations offer a view that your average luxury hotel would kill for .
Not only that , but the setting is appealingly serene -- there 's nothing around but fields and farmland .
( You might even forget that the Lascaux Cave , home of France 's most famous prehistoric paintings , is just a five-minute walk away .
) Though none of the five rooms gets the view face-on , you can take in the scenery over cafe au lait in the breakfast room or simply plop down on the hillside at any time of day .
One of the rooms has a small private terrace , so book well ahead ; unlike most of these hotels , Le Bellevue is open year-round .
Regourdou , 011-33/5-53-51-81-29 , chambres-montignac.com , $ 55-- $ 59 .

LES EYZIES-DE-TAYAC

Les Glycines

Les Eyzies is a bustling town that sells itself as Cro-Magnon Central because it 's an ideal base for visiting the area 's prehistoric sites .
Hovering on the outskirts , Les Glycines is a hotel that offers stylish comfort in a low-key , no-pressure kind of way .
What started out as a 19th-century postal relay has been turned into an assortment of inviting rooms decorated in a soothing palette of cream , taupe and beige .
The rooms that have a view cost more , but for the extra &euro ; 30 , you 'll be able to contemplate the splendid garden , pool and landscape first thing in the morning .
Many of the ingredients for the gourmet meals served in Les Glycines ' dining room come from the enormous potager , or kitchen garden .
4 ave. de Laugerie , 011-33/5-53-06-97-07 , les-glycines-dordogne.com , $ 136-- $ 239 , half pension is from $ 286 for two people ( half pension is mandatory from mid-July through August ) .

Le Moulin de la Beune

The small , family-run hotel has a lot of charm thanks to co-owner Annick Soulie , who believes that her job is 'to make people happy .
' The old stone building is a vine-covered , 17th-century mill .
The rooms are simple , but the nice draperies give them a little personality .
If your room faces the stream , you 'll be treated to the sound of water rushing by , which would be idyllic if it were n't for the traffic on the road during high season ( it calms down after 7 p.m. ) .
With what you 've saved on your room , you can treat yourself to a meal at the acclaimed restaurant , Au Vieux Moulin ; the chef is Annick 's husband , Georges Soulie .
Be careful not to fall into the stream after you indulge in a few glasses of Bergerac .
2 rue du Moulin Bas , 011-33/5-53-06-94-33 , moulindelabeune.com , $ 90-- $ 103 , half pension is from $ 212 for two people ; dinner from $ 47 .

LE COUX ET BIGAROQUE

Le Chambellan

A couple of years ago , Virginie and Philippe Vue , young professionals from Normandy , gave their lives a makeover .
They moved to the sleepy hamlet of Le Coux et Bigaroque , about 20 miles west of Sarlat , where they spruced up three stone buildings once affiliated with the church across the street .

There are 15 guest rooms and though the lodgings are still somewhat humble , the surroundings are so lovely you 'll easily forgive a few spots on the carpet : The courtyard is filled with flowers and trees , and the Dordogne flows just half a mile away .
In fact , a short walk takes you to one of the river 's few official beaches , where there 's a lifeguard on duty during high season .
The Vues live on-site with their three children , who 'll share their slide and swing set with younger guests .
Families will also appreciate the larger rooms , which can sleep four or five .
Breakfast and dinner are served in the airy dining room or outside under the trellis .
Le Chambellan is closed in December and January .
Place de l ' Eglise , 011-33/5-53-29-90-11 , coux-et-bigaroque.fr/chambellan , $ 71 , half pension is $ 136 for two people .

SARLAT

La Maison des Peyrat

Sarlat is probably the prettiest town in the Dordogne , but its popularity can make for a less-than-tranquil experience -- all the more reason to stay at La Maison des Peyrat , about half a mile uphill in a residential neighborhood .
The long , one-story stone building dates back to the Middle Ages and at various times was a hospital for plague victims , a residence for nuns and a farm .
( Part of its appeal was ample water -- note the well in what is now the hotel 's reception area .
) Current owners Martine and Jean-Luc Ginestet preserved the historic character of the building , while also injecting a dash of modern design .

The result is 10 simple , airy rooms in light colors with rattan furniture ; common areas feature exposed beams and original artwork , including some of Martine 's sculptures .
Outside , a chestnut tree shades the terrace where breakfast and dinner are served in good weather , and foliage surrounds the building and the swimming pool .
If you stay for a few days , you 'll probably end up partaking in the afternoon apero , when everyone gathers for a drink while the sun goes down .
Le Lac de la Plane , 011-33/5-53-59-00-32 , maisondespeyrat.com , $ 100-- $ 140 , half pension is from $ 189 for two people .

Le Mas de Castel

Just a couple of miles south of Sarlat is a small hotel that feels like it 's leagues away from tourists and crowds .
Everything about it is soft-spoken , including owner Francine Charpenet Mottet , who transformed the family farm into a relaxing vacation spot .
The grounds feature a pool , a garden and rosebushes , and there are even plans to create a picnic area for guests .
' Comfort ' rooms are decorated in yellows , blues and reds ; the larger 'superior ' rooms ( &euro ; 10 more ) have private entrances and terraces that open out onto the garden .
While the hotel has no restaurant , if you opt for a superior room , you can picnic at your outdoor table .
Le Mas de Castel is one of the rare hotels in the area with a handicapped-accessible room ; in any event , most rooms are on the ground floor .
The cone-roofed structure next to the pool is a re-creation of a borie -- mortarless , flat-stone huts that have existed for thousands of years in the south of France .
Le Sudalissant , 011-33/5-53-59-02-59 , hotel-lemasdecastel.com , $ 89-- $ 139 .

LA ROQUE-GAGEAC

La Belle Etoile

Hovering over the banks of the Dordogne , the ancient auberge ( no one knows exactly how old it is ) has 15 spacious rooms and a superb restaurant .
In fact , chef Regis Ongaro owns the hotel -- it 's been in his family for four generations .
The same attention that gets showered on the food is apparent in the hotel 's service : Guests ' comfort is clearly a priority .
There 's nothing particularly hip about the decor , which includes gold-toned fabrics and regional antiques , but the soothing atmosphere is a perfect counterpoint to the buzz just outside .
The medieval town butts up against -- and parts of it are carved into -- a cliff in a bend of the river , and its beauty draws crowds in high season .
If you 're searching for solitude , hunker down in the hotel 's sitting room .
The windows and high ceilings let in lots of light , and the hunting-lodge decor will help you forget the 21st century .
Le Bourg , 011-33/5-53-29-51-44,sarlat-tourisme.com ( click on 'Hotels and guest houses ' ; then check off 'Village ' and 'Logis de France, ' and click 'Search ' ) , $ 111 , half pension ( for stays longer than three nights ) is $ 230 for two ; dinner starts at $ 38 ( reserve a week in advance ) .

VITRAC

La Treille

Philippe Latreille 's great-great-grandmother used to run a ferry from the landing just down the street from this old stone house , steering the wooden boat across the river herself .
Once the bridge was built , the ferry service folded , and she had to come up with another way to feed the family .
For the first 100 years of its existence , La Treille was simply a restaurant ; the hotel opened in 1960 .
While the restaurant is still the main attraction -- Latreille is a well-known chef -- the hotel is a worthwhile value .
Several of the seven rooms in the main building look out onto a garden ; two face the road ( one of the main routes to Sarlat , it can get clogged during high season ; fortunately , traffic disappears by evening ) .
An annex is home to a few family-size rooms .
The hotel 's name , by the way , refers not only to the owners , but also to the century-old grape arbor ( treille ) on the restaurant 's terrace .
Philippe Latreille offers on-site cooking classes to small groups , except in July and August ; the hotel is open all year .
Le Port , 011-33/5-53-28-33-19 , latreille-perigord.com , $ 77-- $ 121 , half pension is from $ 201 for two people .

ROCAMADOUR

Domaine de la Rhue

After raising sheep for 15 years , Eric Jooris wanted a change .
So he transformed the 19th-century stables on the family property into a beautiful country inn .
The beams that used to separate the horse stalls have been incorporated into the spacious lobby , and the latticed ceiling support is exposed on the upper floor .
That said , you wo n't be sleeping on straw .
The hotel was completed 18 years ago , but you 'd never know from looking at the rooms , which are spotless , with an uncluttered , elegant look .
The generosity of space is rare in French lodgings : Ceilings are high , and windows are plentiful .
The view adds to the effect -- aside from the enormous manor house out back ( that 's where Jooris 's parents live ) , all you see are vast fields and open countryside .
A hiking trail leads to the chapels and churches of Rocamadour , a spectacular medieval pilgrimage site carved into a cliff .
If you do n't feel like walking , you can drive there in a matter of minutes .
