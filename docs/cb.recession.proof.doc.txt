Is your job recession-proof? - CNN.com
Though it 's difficult to predict exactly how the year will pan out , weak job growth , a slowing economy and troubled housing markets all point to signs of an economic recession .
The good news for job seekers is that employers are still hiring and certain industries will survive ( even thrive ) during hard times .

Thirty-two percent of employers plan to add full-time , permanent employees in 2008 , according to a CareerBuilder.com survey .
Most employers are cautious , but anticipate a slower , yet steady hiring environment .

' Many job seekers make the mistake of attempting a career change during downturns, ' says John A. Challenger , chief executive officer of Challenger , Gray &amp ; Christmas , a global outplacement consultancy .
' This can be a career-crippling move .
It is much better to focus on transferring your current occupations skills to industries that remain healthy. '

While some industries , including retail , manufacturing , finance and technology , are vulnerable during recessions , Challenger says there are always industries that seem 'recession-resistant, ' based on different trends at the time of the slowdown .

' Do not make the mistake of thinking that only those with industry-specific skills will be in demand .
Hospitals not only need nurses and physical therapists , they need administrators and information technology workers, ' Challenger says .
' Firms specializing in information security need accountants and marketing professionals in addition to computer programmers .
There should be a wide variety of opportunities in the industries that remain strong through the slowdown. '
