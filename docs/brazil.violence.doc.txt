Protesters use 16,000 coconuts as symbols of violence - CNN.com
RIO DE JANEIRO , Brazil ( CNN ) -- Antiviolence protesters stretched out 16,000 coconuts on Brazil 's world-famous Copacabana beach Saturday , each one representing a victim of urban violence .

Activists from ONG Rio de Paz led a protest march Saturday morning that included residents and tourists who usually can be found on the beach on weekends .

The protesters strung up a sign on the sand that said 'Shame ' in Spanish , Portuguese , English and French .

They finished with a minute of silence for the victims of violence .

Rio de Paz said the coconuts represent victims of violence , homicides , dead police officers and those who have been shot in gunfights between authorities and gangs of narcotics traffickers .

The figure itself was obtained from official information from the Rio de Janeiro governmental Institute of Public Security .

It was the second protest staged this week on Rio de Janeiro 's Copacabana beach by the group Rio de Paz .

On Tuesday , the group created a mock cemetery in the sand with mannequins representing 9,000 people who Rio de Paz says have been slain and secretly buried since January 2007 .

Rio de Paz President Antonio Carlos Costa said he believes that about 6,000 of the missing people were killed , many by drug traffickers fighting for territory in Rio 's slums and poor neighborhoods .
Others , he said , were killed by hit squads and police acting on their own .

' In general , they are assassinated by police -- police acting outside of their regular work hours, ' Costa said Tuesday .

' They are also assassinated by narcotraffickers .
The bodies are disposed of in secret cemeteries in the metropolitan Rio de Janeiro area or incinerated alive by narcotraffickers in what they call 'microwaves .

To illustrate the point , demonstrators also constructed facsimiles of the 'microwaves ' that narcotics traffickers and death squads reportedly use to cremate remains of those they have abducted .
