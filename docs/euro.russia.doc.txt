Rampant Russia make last-8 date with Dutch  - CNN.com
INNSBRUCK , Austria -- Rampant Russia rediscovered their flair with a goal in each half on Wednesday to beat Sweden 2-0 and advance to the European Championship quarterfinals .

Roman Pavlyuchenko scored in the first half and Andrei Arshavin , coming off a two-match suspension , made it 2-0 right after the break to set up a match against the Netherlands on Saturday in Basel .

Russia finished second behind Spain on six points in Group D , three ahead of Sweden .

The youthful Russians outpaced the experienced Swedes to qualify for the knockout stage for the first time since the break up of the Soviet Union .

Russia coach Guus Hiddink , who has maintained his record of reaching the knockout stage in every international tournament he has coached at , will now take on his home country having led them to the semifinals of the 1998 World Cup .

' This is a huge win for a side still under construction , with lots of young players and some experienced players, ' said Hiddink .

' It gives me real pleasure to work with them .
In the course of the past three weeks these youngsters have learnt a lot. '

For Sweden , who only needed a draw to advance , it was the first group stage exit at a major tournament since Euro 2000 , but coach Lars Lagerback was gracious in defeat .

' I would like to congratulate the Russians , who really play joyful football, ' he said .
' I think they saw rapidly where they could hurt us and they exploited our weaknesses perfectly. '

Hiddink 's move to pick Arshavin in his starting team paid off as the playmaker picked up a pass from Yuri Zhirkov in a fast Russian counterattack and scored with a right-footed shot in the 50th minute .

The goal stunned the Swedes , who had struggled to contain Russia 's attack throughout the first half .

Pavlyuchenko had given Russia the lead in the 24th after being set up inside the box by Aleksandr Anyukov following a series of quick passes that ripped open the defense .

The Russians opened aggressively knowing they needed a win to stay alive in the tournament .
Their pressure resulted in a string of corner kicks but no clear opportunities until Yuri Zhirkov 's hard volley in the 21st went just outside Isaksson 's left post .

Henrik Larsson had Sweden 's best chance with a first-half header that hit the crossbar , but Russia nearly got its second goal in the 36th when Pavlyuchenko 's shot also hit the woodwork .

Diniyar Bilyaletdinov headed the rebound to force goalkeeper Andreas Isaksson into a diving save .

Russia goalkeeper Igor Akinfeyev stopped shots from Fredrik Ljungberg and Nilsson as Sweden surged before the break .

' I 'm tired and very disappointed, ' the 36-year-old Larsson said after the match .
' We did n't have a whole lot of chances .
I had one on the crossbar , I ca n't remember many more. '

Russia piled up chances as the Swedes opened themselves up to dangerous counterattacks by pushing forward toward the end of the game .
Konstantin Zyryanov almost added a third for Russia when his shot deflected off Sweden defender Petter Hansson to hit the post .

' I think we were too passive , especially in the first half, ' Lagerback added .
' We tried to lift ourselves up in the second half , but then they scored an early goal and it became and an uphill battle. '
