'Honey, you're really sick' - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- When her mother and father called her into the den , 9-year-old Gigi Pasley thought they were going to tell her a big surprise , 'a good surprise ' she said , one she 'd be delighted to hear .

But instead , as her father sat next to her on the couch and her mother knelt down beside her , they told Gigi she had cancer .
Her reaction was not what her parents expected .
She sat quietly , with her head down , for a long time .

' And then she burst out with this awful sound , a moan , a scream of complete and utter agony, ' said her mother , Jessica Pasley .
' She was completely distraught , so much so that my husband , who 's a big , tough guy , had to leave the room .
He had to walk away. '

When she finally managed to talk , Gigi said , 'I do n't want to die at age 9. '

The Pasleys learned that day there 's no good way to tell your child she has cancer .

When it comes time to tell a child he or she has cancer , or some other devastating disease , many parents try to skirt the issue .

' They say , 'Well , we 'll tell her it 's just a cold , or it 's just a virus , or we 'll tell her she 'll have surgery and then everything will be fine,' ' said Dr. Lawrence Wolfe , a pediatric hematologist-oncologist at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New York .

But he said the child always figures it out in the end .
'Truth-telling pays off , even if you 're clumsy about it, ' he said .

Other experts agree .

The American Society of Clinical Oncology and the National Cancer Institute , both of which have guidelines for how to talk to children about cancer , stress the importance of honesty .

' You may want to protect your child , but children usually know when something is wrong, ' the National Cancer Institute 's Web site says .
Not telling the truth can lead to more problems .
' A child may think he or she has cancer as a punishment for doing something wrong. '

When Gigi 's bone cancer was diagnosed , the Pasleys knew enough to be straight with her .
They 'd had experience with cancer : Gigi and her identical twin sister , Jade , were found to have leukemia shortly after their first birthday .
Jade died a year later .
Gigi beat the disease , only to have a relapse when she was 4 years old .
Again , she recovered -- and the cancer returned for a second time when she was 6 .

Now 11 , Gigi said she appreciates her parents ' honesty that night in the den two years ago when they told her about her bone cancer .

' I was upset and really scared when they told me because this time it was a new cancer, ' she said .
' But I was thinking to myself , if I beat leukemia already as many times as I did -- three times -- I can beat this cancer, ' and I did. '

But the Pasleys did n't tell their daughter absolutely everything .
They did n't say that her doctors thought she might have only three months to live , even with aggressive treatment .
' We never talk about timetables, ' Jessica Pasley said .
' It does n't make any sense to us. '

Exactly what you say to a child who 's just received a terrible diagnosis depends on the illness , the child 's personality , and on the child 's age .
Here are some basic guidelines by age group .

What to tell children up to age 4

Very young children might think they did something to cause cancer , according to the American Society of Clinical Oncology , and need to be reassured this is n't the case .

But often children this age are n't focused on the illness , Wolfe said .
Rather , they 're focused on their parents and are very sensitive to their behavior .

Since seeing a parent cry might be unavoidable , it needs to be explained to them .
' Tell them Mommy and Daddy may be upset about their illness , but you 're not upset with them, ' he advises .

What to tell children from 4 to 7 years old

Wolfe said children this age are more aware of their illness , but their biggest fear probably is n't illness or death -- it 's being separated from their parents .

' Explain to them , 'You 're sick and going to have to spend time in the hospital .
Mommy and Daddy will always be there to comfort you .
We 're always there for you .

What to tell children from 8 to 13 years old

The National Cancer Institute suggests explaining cancer to children this age in terms they can understand .
' You might describe the cancer cells as 'troublemakers ' that get in the way of the work of the good cells, ' the Web site suggests .
' Treatment helps to get rid of the troublemakers so that other cells can work well together. '

Wolfe advises also telling children about their illnesses in the context of their own day-to-day life .
' If you just say , 'You 're very sick and will have to be in the hospital for a while, ' that might not speak to the child , because he or she might not understand what 'for a while ' means, ' he said .

' If your child 's life , for example , revolves around sports , say , 'You might not be able to do sports as much .
We have to curtail your activities to make you well .
' Do truth telling in language they 'll understand. '

What to tell a teenager

Telling the truth is perhaps most important for adolescents , Wolfe said .
If they ever sense you 're lying , they 'll feel as if their illness is even more out of control than it already is .

' Any attempt to soften the blow -- that 's where the adolescent loses their footing, ' Wolfe said .
' In order to have their feet on the ground , they need to know the truth. '

He warns parents against trying to hide their own grief and sadness , because teenagers might mistake your stoicism for not caring .
' If you feel like you have to fall apart , you should fall apart .
If parents want to seem to be in control , what could go through the teen mind is that they do n't seem to care, ' he said .

Also , parents should try to prepare themselves for their teenagers ' 'heart-wrenching ' reactions to news of a cancer diagnosis -- reactions sometimes even more intense than those of a younger child .

Wolfe adds that being honest does n't mean you have to tell your child everything .
For example , he said the Pasleys did the right thing by not telling Gigi doctors thought she might have only three months to live .

' I do n't think that future-predicting truth telling is necessary -- the kind where you 're looking into a crystal ball, ' he said .
' If the child is sophisticated to say , 'Am I going to die of this ?
' you can answer that it 's a possibility , but we 're embarking on a plan now to try to keep that from happening. '

Gigi 's lived way beyond those three months .
Nearly two years after her bone cancer diagnosis , doctors ca n't find evidence of the cancer anywhere in her body .

' It was hard to get through it , but I did, ' Gigi said .
' And I 'm proud of myself, ' she said .
