Teenager Rory leads Dubai Desert Classic - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- Precocious teenager Rory McIlroy takes a two-shot lead into the final day of the fog-hit Dubai Desert Classic as he chases his first European Tour win .

The 19-year-old from Northern Ireland is tipped for golfing stardom and has left some of the biggest names in the sport trailing at the Emirates Golf Club .

McIllroy initially charged to the top of the leaderboard by eagling the par-five 18th to complete a four-under-par 68 second round early on Saturday morning .

It left him with a halfway total of 12-under 132 -- one shot clear of South Africa 's Louis Oosthuizen and Henrik Stenson of Sweden .

With organizers keen to get as much play as possible so the tournament can be finished on Sunday , the field were quickly sent out for their third rounds .

McIllroy again took advantage , eagling his final hole of the day , the 10th with an approach to two-feet , to reach 15-under-par with 26 holes left to play .

He is two clear of former champion Richard Green of Australia and in-form Oosthuizen , who earlier in the day fired a hole in one on the short 11th .

Former world amateur number one McIlroy was beaten in two playoffs on his first full professional season and is tantalizingly close to achieving his goal of a win .

' It would be a huge first victory , it 's one of the best events on Tour .
For this to be my first win , if I could pull it off , it would be absolutely fantastic, ' McIlroy was quoted on the official Tour Web site www.europeantour.com .

But he is being chased by a strong field with Justin Rose , Martin Kaymer , Scott Strange , Thomas Levet and Abu Dhabi winner Paul Casey well placed at 10-under .

Former champions Robert-Jan Derksen and Dubai-based Stenson are also in touching distance at nine-under .

European number one Robert Karlsson of Sweden is on eight- under with world number two Sergio Garcia a further shot back .
