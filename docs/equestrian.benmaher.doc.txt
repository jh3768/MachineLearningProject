Ben Maher: Ready for the Olympic hurdle - CNN.com
HONG KONG , China ( CNN ) -- Young British show-jumping rider Ben Maher is refreshed , having just returned from the opening ceremonies of the Olympic equestrian events in Hong Kong .
Before he left England to make the long first-time trip to Hong Kong , he was named a new Scout Association award recipient for equestrian excellence .

This award has been granted in the past to big name UK celebrities such as chef Jaime Oliver and actor Ewan McGregor .

He does not consider himself a celebrity , despite already being named a top-10 rider in the UK .

He bounced back this year after what he believed to be an unsuccessful 2007 and a key win at the Hickstead Derby in 2006 that propelled his riding career to where he is today .

Soft-spoken , calm , polite and modest , 25-year-old Maher is a consummate riding professional that belies the fact that he is the youngest member of the UK equestrian team .

He shows no sign of anxiety settling in , relaxed at his team 's hotel lobby in Tsim Sha Tsui , Kowloon , in preparation for the Olympic Games that kick off the same night .

Maher sits down with CNN to chat about his horse , Rolette , while experiencing Hong Kong and the Olympics with fresh eyes .

CNN : What are your impressions of Hong Kong so far ?

Maher : Fantastic city .
Very busy , never sleeps by the looks of things .

It 's my first Olympics , [ and ] I was n't expecting the facilities to be as good as they are .
The stables have air-conditioning , the grounds for the show jumping , in particular , which I do , was perfect .
I look forward to competing next week .

CNN : Is it a dream come true ?

Maher : Absolutely .
I 'm quite young compared to the other people on my team , so I have got a lot of experience from them to try and help me... Maybe not so much is sort of expected of me .
But equally where we are , there is a lot of pressure , and it 's quite hard to make our team in Britain .
It 's not easy , we have a lot of good riders and good horses .
I just have to do my own thing , really , and I 'm expected to jump clear rounds , as the others are , to try and win .
I think we can do quite well here .

CNN : What advantages do you think your team has over some the other ones in this year 's event ?

Maher : I think we have a lot of experience on our team .
Not necessarily with myself , but [ with ] the other riders that we have on our team .
This will be our first time as a combination team that we 're together all at once , and I think that if we produce the results that we 've had , we should stand a good chance .
We do everything together , we train together ; we go out together while we 're here , and we look to try to help each other in every way possible .

CNN : How have you prepared or trained differently for the Olympics as opposed to other competitions in the past ?

Maher : We 've spent a long time with fitness work [ for the horses ] and preparing them for the journey and the heat that 's here .
I think the horses have been prepared very well , and they should cope with the different weather situations .

CNN : Are there any concerns about typhoons ?
It 's going to be thunder-storming for the rest of the weekend.. .

Maher : Obviously , we 're not used to this weather in England .
We 're used to rain , but obviously not with it being so hot .
Again , I think our horses are in fantastic facilities with air-conditioning , and today I rode in the indoor arena with air-conditioning and you do n't know the difference with the weather outside , actually , and the horses seem to be coping fine .

CNN : Can you tell us a bit about your horse , Rolette ?

Maher : Rolette is a 10-year-old bay mare .
I 've been riding her for almost a year now .
We were in America for two months in the beginning of this year .
Maybe a little bit inexperienced obviously at this level.. .

CNN : How would you describe the chemistry between you and Rolette ?
Why did you choose Rolette ?

Maher : She 's the only horse I have that has the ability and the potential to jump the fences that we 're going to try and jump here .
But I get along great with her -- She 's a bit temperamental sometimes .
This morning I rode her , and I have n't ridden her for a few days , obviously , because she has been flying in here [ from the UK ] .

She 's getting very well pampered at the moment .
A lot of people were around just her... We work very well together .
She trusts me and I trust her .

CNN : What makes a good show-jumping horse ?

Maher : I think they need to have the ability , and most importantly , is a big heart .
If they want to do it for you and you have good communication , then you can normally come ahead of the rest of the pack .

CNN : What do you think are the dangers of sport-enhancing drugs in horses in the competitions ?

Maher : As far as I 'm aware , our sport is a very clean and healthy sport .
In England , we have one of the best doping programs there are in the world , in fact .
As far as I 'm aware , the horses are all very fit and healthy , and we do n't have any problems .

CNN : Last year was difficult for your riding performance .
Why ?

Maher : I just had a bad year .
I struggled a little bit with a lack of top horses .
It was just genuinely a difficult year .
I think everybody goes through these stages , and fortunately enough , it did n't last too long and we 've come out .
And at the moment , everything is going great .
I 've won this year in one month what I won the whole year last year , so at the moment I 'm riding the top of the wave .
I have a good selection of horses at home and I try not to think of those [ difficult ] times too much ( laughs ) .

CNN : Who is your biggest competitor ?

Maher : I think Germany is always the biggest rivalry .
They are for sure the favorites going into the competition .
I think anybody on their given day , really .
I would say that Holland , the United States along with us , [ they all have ] a similar kind of ability .
Like I say , you never know , Germany may make mistakes.. .

CNN : One of the local favorites is rider , Alex Hua Tian , who is 18 years old , and half-British and half-Chinese .
He 's competing on behalf of China .

Maher : I think he 's lucky to represent his country in the Olympic Games when he is only 18 .
I met him earlier today , actually , just in passing for the first time , and he seemed very polite and said hello .
It 's great for China and , obviously , he 's generating a lot of publicity for our sport and yeah , I hope he does well , he deserves it .

CNN : Would you rather have him compete on the British side ?

Maher : Absolutely .
Any good riders and horses , we welcome .
If he was on the British side , then it 's another person to try to compete against and to make the British team .
But obviously , if in the near future he decides to change to ride for Britain , then it would be to our advantage .

CNN : Do you have any favorite horse or rider combination that you 're looking out for ?

Maher : I think that [ Dutch rider ] Albert Zoer with Oki Doki , the horse , before the Games , would have been the favorite to win here , but unfortunately , I think the rider had a small accident so that he was n't able to compete now .
There are so many good combinations here .
It would be hard to decide who was going to win .
I think that the Olympic Games can produce an 'outside winner ' a lot of the time with how the system works .
We 'll see everybody has a chance .

CNN : If you were n't in riding , what would be your other career ?

Maher : If it was to be sport , I would like the idea of being a Formula One driver or a golf player or something , but I 'm not , so... ( laughs ) I love what I do , and hopefully we can get some good results here that can keep me on the right path .

CNN : What are your plans after the competitions ?

Maher : Obviously , a lot depends on the result from here .
It 's possible that I will go to Spruce Meadows in Calgary [ Canada ] and then... [ I 'm ] probably going again to Florida in the beginning of next year , building up again , then toward the London Olympics in 2012 .
Having an Olympics at home [ will give me ] a clearer advantage , because it gives me the experience already .
Hopefully , I 'll have the right horses when the time comes around .
