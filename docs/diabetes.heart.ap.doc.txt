Panel urges stricter diabetes drug testing  - CNN.com
WASHINGTON ( AP ) -- Diabetes drugs would be subject to more stringent safety standards that could cost manufacturers millions of dollars , under recommendations made Wednesday by a government panel .

Advisers to the Food and Drug Administration voted 14-2 that all new diabetes drugs should undergo longer studies to assure they do n't increase risks of heart problems .

The opinions from diabetes experts , cardiologists and statisticians come less than a year after the FDA was criticized for its handling of heart risks connected with a widely used GlaxoSmithKline pill .
The drug was approved in 1999 but the agency did n't add a warning about potential heart risks until last November .

The majority of the panel said drug companies could begin safety testing -- expected to take between five and seven years to complete -- before they submit drugs to the FDA and finish the studies after their release .

But at least one panelist doubted whether the proposed studies would actually uncover heart risks .

' If you wait this amount of time for testing you 're going to be preventing certain drugs from getting out there that may be better than what we already have, ' said Dr. Eric Felner , a pediatric specialist at Emory University School of Medicine .

The FDA is not required to follow the panel 's advise , though it often does .

If the recommendation is adopted , development of diabetes drugs would become longer and more expensive , since it can cost tens of millions of dollars to perform long-term studies that track heart problems in thousands of patients .

GlaxoSmithKline PLC , AstraZeneca and Novartis AG are among the companies developing diabetes treatments to compete in the domestic market , which grew to over $ 6 billion last year , according to pharmaceutical research firm IMS Heath .

Takeda Pharmaceuticals ' Actos , GlaxoSmithKline 's Avandia , and Eli Lilly and Amylin Pharmaceutical 's Byetta currently dominate the U.S. market .

Nearly 24 million Americans have Type 2 diabetes , which can lead to kidney failure , blindness and heart disease .

The FDA was pressured to reconsider how it approves diabetes medications after an analysis released last year showed GlaxoSmithKline 's blockbuster drug Avandia may increase patients ' risk of heart attack .

The agency currently approves diabetes drugs based on their ability to lower blood sugar levels , since the condition is characterized by excessive blood sugar .
But Dr. Steven Nissen , who authored the analysis on Avandia , said Tuesday that criterion has little value if drugs also increase heart problems .

The FDA is operating under 'the irrational belief that lowering blood sugar using virtually any pharmacological means will produce ' better results for patients , said Nissen , who is chairman of cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic .

He recommended the FDA require drug companies to prove their drugs do not have significant heart risks before granting approval .
After the drugs are on the market , companies would be required to complete large , multiyear studies to confirm their safety .

FDA scientists and outside researchers have warned that saddling companies with additional safety requirements could slow the development of new medications .

' The fallacy here is that we will never know everything we 'd like to about a drug before it goes on the market, ' Dr. Ray Woosley , president of the Critical Path Institute in Tucson , Arizona , said in a phone interview Tuesday .
' If we held up drugs until we did know everything a lot of people would die. '

The institute is a nonprofit partnership with the FDA that aims to speed up the development of new drugs .

Approving drugs based on biological measurements , like blood sugar levels in diabetics , is thought to be a promising method for speeding-up drug development because the results can be gathered relatively quickly .
But that approach is under scrutiny , as some lawmakers and medical experts believe the FDA should not approve drugs without evidence they improve more meaningful measures like increasing patients ' life span .

Sen. Charles Grassley , R-Iowa , is investigating the FDA 's approval of Avandia and another drug Vytorin , which was also cleared based on biological test results .

The agency approved Vytorin , jointly marketed by Merck &amp ; Co. Inc. and Schering-Plough Corp. , based on its ability to lower bad cholesterol , which is widely believed to reduce heart attacks and deaths .

But a study released in January showed Vytorin was no more effective at limiting deadly plaque buildup than a low-cost generic drug .

Since then , the FDA has denied approval of another highly anticipated cholesterol drug from Merck , prompting speculation by analysts that the agency is raising approval standards for those medications .
The FDA has not said whether such changes are in the works .
