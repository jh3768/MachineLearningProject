The eagle was found in 2005 slowly starving to death at a landfill in Alaska .
Most of its upper beak had been shot away , leaving its tongue and sinuses exposed .
A mechanical engineer offered to design an artificial beak .
With the new beak , the 7-year-old bald eagle could live to the age of 50 .
