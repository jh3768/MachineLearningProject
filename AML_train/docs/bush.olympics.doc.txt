Bush pressed Vladimir Putin , the Russian prime minister , to accept a cease-fire when the two leaders were in Beijing , saying , 'this violence is unacceptable. '

' I was very firm with Vladimir Putin -- he and I have got a good relationship -- just like I was firm with the Russian president, ' Dmitry Medvedev , Bush told NBC on Sunday .

' I expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of Russia and that we strongly condemn , you know , bombing outside of South Ossetia, ' Bush said , referring to the region in Georgia that has seen some of the heaviest fighting .
' It was just interesting to me that here we are , trying to promote peace and harmony , and we 're witnessing a conflict take place. '

But the president also had time to show his support for America 's Olympic athletes over the weekend .

Human rights advocates criticized Bush for going to China during the Olympics , saying the presidential visit rewarded a country that is often criticized for having a poor human rights record .

' In the long run , America better remain engaged with China and understand that we can have a cooperative and constructive , yet candid , relationship, ' Bush told NBC .
' It 's really important for future presidents to understand the relationship between China and the region , and it 's important to make sure that America is engaged with China , even though we may have some disagreements. '

While saying , 'I do n't need the Olympics to advance America 's agenda, ' the president said he pressed Hu Jintao on a number of issues during his formal meeting with the Chinese president , including human rights and the nuclear programs of North Korea and Iran .
