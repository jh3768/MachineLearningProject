Marino takes one-shot Congressional lead - CNN.com
BETHESDA , Maryland ( AP ) -- Steve Marino used to consider it a treat the few times he played Congressional as a teenager .
It was a thrill on Thursday to play bogey-free in the first round of the AT&amp ; T National and shoot 5-under 65 for a one-shot lead .

Marino , who grew up a half-hour away in Fairfax , Virginia , birdied three of his opening four holes , never had a par putt longer than 5 feet and finished off his round with an 8-foot ( 2.4-meter ) birdie to be in the lead after any round for only the second time in his career .

' I played a bunch of junior golf growing up here , all over the D.C. area , so it feels great to get off to this good start, ' Marino said .
' And I 'm looking forward to the rest of the week. '

It 's already been a big week for Jeff Overton and Frank Lickliter , who were among those at 66 .

Overton had missed six of his last seven cuts , working harder than ever with nothing to show for it , until the 36-hole qualifier Monday outside Detroit for the British Open .
He was the medalist , earning his first trip to a major .

' It just carried over from there, ' he said .

Lickliter , whose wife gave birth to twin sons in January , took them to Christ Church in Georgetown to have Storm and Steel christened .

' It was fantastic, ' he said .
' We celebrated all day , so there went practice on Wednesday. '

But it must have been inspirational for Lickliter , who had not made a cut in his last six tournaments dating to the EDS Byron Nelson Championship .
After four birdies on his front nine , he recovered from a pair of bogeys with consecutive birdies , including a 5-iron that was among the best he ever hit .

He hit a big drive on the 522-yard sixth hole , converted to a par 4 for this tournament , then hit a 5-iron from 210 yards over the water to about 12 feet ( 3.6 meters ) from the flag .

' Best shot I 've hit in the last four years, ' he said .

Rod Pampling and Bob Estes were also at 66 , while the large group at 67 including Anthony Kim and Notah Begay III , a teammate of Tiger Woods at Stanford who received one of the sponsor 's exemptions .

Woods , the tournament host and star attraction on the PGA Tour , is out for the rest of the year recovering from knee surgery .
Thursday 's attendance in gorgeous weather was 17,000 , which was 1,345 fewer than last year when the AT&amp ; T National made its debut .

It did n't look that big , perhaps because the fans were scattered among various groups .

Among the most vocal were those following Marino , which does n't happen to him anywhere else on the PGA Tour .

' I got some crazy friends that came out to watch me this week, ' he said .
' And today , I think it 's safe to say it was probably going to be the mildest day , especially if I keep playing well .
I know tomorrow is July 4th , and I 'm teeing off in the afternoon .
So that gives them plenty of time for to get looped up .

' They 're rowdy , but it definitely feels good to have them out there supporting me. '

Even better was the Blue Course , which was a real monster when this tournament was held for the first time last year .
Congressional will host the U.S. Open for the third time in 2011 , and the rough was U.S. Open quality a year ago .

This year , it was significantly less severe , but still punishing .

' The rough is probably half as tall as it was last year, ' Marino said .

Among the six birdies Pampling had was the 14th hole , where he drove into the rough and hit his approach to 4 feet ( 1.2 meters ) .
He was asked what would have happened a year ago from the same spot .

' I would have been trying to hit it short of the bunkers and then chip on, ' Pampling said .
' It 's fantastic .
It gives you a chance .
But you can get a flier lie and go long , and then you 're in trouble .
Ryuji Imada was about where I was in the rough and he went over the bunker .
He did well to make bogey. '

Defending champion K.J .
Choi was among 34 players who shot in the 60s .
Choi had a 68 , while the group at 69 included Hunter Mahan .

Fred Couples , who took over Woods ' duties as host on Wednesday during opening ceremonies , shot a 71 .

Another big improvement were the greens , which were criticized last year as too bumpy .
They became crusty in the late afternoon , when temperatures climbed above 33 degrees Celsius , but there were few complaints .

' If the greens stay this smooth , I think everyone is going to enjoy the course, ' Kim said .
