Are you an obnoxious patient? - CNN.com
Empowered Patient , a regular feature from CNN Medical News correspondent Elizabeth Cohen , helps put you in the driver 's seat when it comes to health care .

ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) -- A few months ago , Dr. David Golden says , he had to fire a patient for being obnoxious .

The patient had a cough .
After examining him , Golden recommended a medication .
But then the patient did his own research and became worried about side effects .

' He said , 'But I read about this on the Internet , and I know this and I know that , and I know I 'm right, ' ' remembered Golden , an allergist in Baltimore , Maryland .

Golden says he tried to explain why the side effects were n't as bad as the patient thought , and why the medicine would take care of his cough .
' But he was n't open to discussing anything .
He countermanded everything I said .
So I told him , 'You know it all , so go take care of yourself .
I 'm not your doctor anymore .

Golden says he 's all for empowered and educated patients , but some patients have become so empowered , they 're actually putting their care in jeopardy .

' I 've been doing this for 28 years , and unquestionably it 's gotten much worse, ' Golden says .

But wait a second .
Is n't it good to question your doctor ?
You do n't want to passively accept everything they say , right ?
Absolutely , say Golden and other physicians .
The doctors we interviewed agreed that getting the best care means being empowered but not obnoxious .
Here are tips from a few of them , plus some from a patient .

Do n't demand medications over the phone

Let 's say you get sinus infections several times a year .
You know what they feel like .
The same medicine helps you each and every time .
You want your doctor 's office to call the prescription in to the pharmacy .
Why should you go in and get examined when you know what 's wrong with you ?
Sounds reasonable , right ?

This issue rankles doctors like none other .
Doctors do n't like prescribing medicine without first seeing the patient , period .

' When my staff asks them to come in , they say they 're too busy and they know what 's wrong with them .
It 's a very common thing, ' says Dr. Jeff Hurwitz , an internist in Hagerstown , Maryland .
' But health care is n't just saying , 'These are my symptoms .
I know what 's wrong with me .
' Medicine is an art .
You need to go see your doctor. '

Hurwitz remembers one patient who demanded medicine for a urinary tract infection over the phone ; she 'd had them before , and she was having one again .
Hurwitz insisted she come in to be seen .
She insisted she would n't .
He won , and it 's a good thing for her : It turned out her symptoms were caused by kidney cancer , not a urinary tract infection .

Do n't come in loaded with Internet printouts

Trisha Torrey , the moderator of about.com 's Patient Empowerment section , recommends making bullet points after reading information on the Internet .
' Do n't bother printing copies of your research for [ your doctor .
] She does n't have time to read them, ' she says .

Another piece of advice : Be careful how you bring up Internet information .
Sounding like you know more than the doctor does could result in alienating your doctor and getting less than optimal care .

Let 's say , for example , you 've been having horrible headaches .
Your doctor thinks it 's nothing serious and you just need a good over-the-counter pain medication , but you 're worried the pain in your head might be something more serious .

You go online and read all about what a headache could be ( a brain tumor , for example ) , and now you want to talk to your physician .
Dr. Delia Chiaramonte , a patient advocate in Baltimore , has these do 's and don'ts :

Do n't say , ''Please look at these printouts .
They say I should have a CT scan to rule out a tumor .
You really need to read these -- when doctors do n't listen to patients , the patients die. '

So what should you say ?
' Acknowledge the slight discomfort of the situation out loud, ' advises Chiaramonte .
' Say , 'I know doctors may not love patients coming in with Internet printouts .
But would you mind looking at these ?
I 'd love to hear your thoughts,' ' Chiaramonte says , adding that you should ask your doctor for Web sites he or she recommends .

Dr. Scott Haig , an orthopedist in New York , agrees .
He says he does n't mind when patients come in with Internet information -- it 's all about how they ask about it .
He says do n't make your doctor feel like his back is up against the wall .
' Permit for an exchange of ideas, ' he says .

Arrive organized

Christine Miserandino has learned a thing or two from her frequent doctor 's appointments for lupus .
Miserandino , who writes about her illness on her Web site , says that before each appointment , she fills out three index cards : one with any new problems she needs to tell her doctor about , one describing her current symptoms , and a third with specific questions for the doctor .

Miserandino says this gets her better care .
' My doctor is busy , and I have to respect that he has 40 patients in one day, ' she says .
' If I do n't go in with all my questions written down , I 'd be rambling all over the place .

Need a lot of time ?
Ask first .

Doctors often schedule appointments in 15-minute increments .
Sometimes you 'll need much more than that .
Miserandino says she always warns the appointment secretary when she 'll need extra time , and asks whether a certain time of day ( such as the last appointment ) would be better .

Chiaramonte also suggests asking whether certain days of the week are bad ( perhaps your doctor has several surgeries scheduled on certain days ) , and says you can also request two appointments back to back .

Exercise basic human kindness

Remember , your doctor is a human being , and we all respond better when we 're treated well .

' Show human courtesy and respect who they are .
I 'm talking basic human interaction 101, ' Haig says .

Miserandino says she does n't shy away from asking tough questions -- on the contrary , she asks lots of them and sometimes questions her doctor 's recommendations -- but she always does it politely .
Plus , she fosters a relationship with her doctor because she knows that to a great extent , her health depends on him .

' I do care , because I want him to care about me .
I do bring cookies at Christmastime .
It 's a relationship you have to foster like any other. '

Once , when her doctor went above and beyond what he had to do by visiting her in the hospital twice in one day , she wrote him a thank-you note .
' He said to me , in the 20-odd years I 've been doing this , I 've never received a thank-you note .
I always hear the negative , never the positive, ' she says .
