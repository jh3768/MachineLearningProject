Commentary: What was Blagojevich thinking? - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- In the great annals of 'What Was He Thinking ?
' ( political edition ) , the case of Illinois Gov .
Rod Blagojevich sets a new standard -- for its breathtaking stupidity , venality and illegality .

Here 's a fellow who knew he was under investigation for 'pay to play ' schemes , who then allegedly continued to extort campaign contributions -- and more -- without any thought that someone was actually watching .

The Illinois governor retires the stupidity trophy currently held by soon-to-be-ex-Rep. William Jefferson , who stuffed $ 90,000 into his freezer .

At least Jefferson tried to hide his criminality .

Blagojevich , it seems , figured he was a Master of the Universe , immune from the scrutiny he should have known he was under .

Of course , the feds were listening .
Sad for the governor , the wiretaps that prosecutors detailed reveal a stunning and disgusting portrayal of a pol trying to extract personal gain from almost anyone -- whether a potential Senate candidate , a children 's hospital or a newspaper .

The breadth of the governor 's behavior -- as outlined in a 78-page criminal complaint -- reads like a caricature of dumb and crooked political behavior .

Sad to say , it 's real .

Let 's start with the smaller stuff , at least in this complaint :

Trying to get some critics from the Chicago Tribune editorial board fired in exchange for state money to assist in the sale of Wrigley Field .

As the governor delicately put it in his demand for a quid pro quo to his deputy ; 'fire those f---ers .
' Charming .

And then , as if no one would notice -- or believe -- the crooked governor was behind the brilliant idea , he suggested his chief of staff , John Harris , make the suggestion , 'not me .
' As if that would confuse the feds .

The stupidity ( I 'm running out of synonyms here ) is only compounded when the governor decides it would be a good idea to raffle off Barack Obama 's Senate seat to the highest bidder .

And , if no one bid high enough , then he just might take the seat himself .
' If ... they 're not going to offer anything of value , then I might just take it, ' the governor said .

Later , the governor put it more , er , succinctly : The Senate seat 'is a f---ing valuable thing , you just do n't give it away for nothing. '

Maybe an ambassadorship .
Maybe an appointment as Health and Human Services secretary -- a 'trade ' as he put it .
Or maybe Energy , a loyal aide suggested , because that department is 'the one that makes the most money. '

Now we 're all getting nauseated .

But it gets worse .
Ever the caring hubby , he 's looking out for his wife 's bottom line , wondering aloud to his top staffer 'if there is a play here , with these guys , with her ' to work for a lobbying firm in Washington or New York at a better salary .
Pay to play ?
Gee , wonder if the feds listening in got a laugh out of that one .

And here 's the coup de grace : This Democratic governor , who apparently has n't been paying attention to anything Obama has said over the past two years , wonders aloud what he can get from Obama .

His general counsel , ever helpful , suggests that maybe Obama would get the gov 's wife on some corporate boards , according to the criminal complaint .
Really ? Is that something Obama -- who wo n't even hire lobbyists for his administration -- would do ?

The stupidity ( really need a new word ) is breathtaking .
Let 's see what story the governor comes up with in his own defense .
It will be hard .
As Richard Nixon learned , the tapes do n't lie .
