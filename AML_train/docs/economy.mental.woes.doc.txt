Economic troubles bring many to the brink - CNN.com
LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) -- Elizabeth Gore , with a voice soaked in motherly calm , counsels her suicidal caller .

' You do n't want to live if you ca n't find a job ; I think we need to send you to an emergency room, ' Gore suggests through her headset .

Gore is among the counselors at the County Mental Heath ACCESS call-in center .
Counselors there reckon with Los Angeles County 's unemployment rate of 9.5 percent , among the worst in the nation .

' Well , it 's a big deal when you tell me that you do n't want to live if you do n't find something, ' Gore stresses to her caller .
' Do you realize what you 're telling me ?
I am not trying to preach , but that 's kind of frightening. '

' Lot 's of people do n't have jobs, ' Gore continues with her caller .
' You 've applied for 200 jobs and only got one call back ? '

' Well do n't get too dismayed and too discouraged, ' Gore says .
' We are going to get you some kind of counseling first. '

Gore hangs in there with her caller like a bent nail .
The suicidal woman agrees to go to a psychological evaluation set up by Gore , at a nearby clinic .

Callers reach the counselors at 800-854-7771 for free .
It 's the same number Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa firmly and clearly broadcasted , after the murder-suicide of seven people Tuesday in the working class neighborhood of Wilmington .

Erwin Lupoe and his wife , Ana , had been fired from their jobs a week before the Wilmington tragedy .
But whether job loss stems from a firing or a layoff , the effects are traumatic .

' I do n't think it 's ever been this bad .
Not in my tenure, ' Gore said .
' Because the people that we 're dealing with now , they have always had [ money ] .
They went to school , they were able to get jobs .
Now the jobs are not even out there. '

Supervisors at the call-in center say many of these calls are not strictly about mental-health issues , but deal with lapsed medical insurance , foreclosure , bank problems and unemployment benefits .

Gore is 70 , a mother of five , with a master 's in Health Administration Management and eight years of handling callers over the phone .

Los Angeles County Mental Health executives say a rising number of people who make that 800 call speak only Spanish .

Maricela Velasquez takes many of the Spanish calls , talking and typing while a little figure of a guardian angel seems to watch over her keyboard .

The counselor says there are barriers , because a lot of Latino callers want help but need an education about therapy and mental health .

' They start telling me , 'no soy loco, ' I am not crazy, ' Velasquez explains .
' They argue they do n't need to go to a home for crazy people .

' A lot of the [ Spanish-speaking ] families do call because they have lost their jobs , or they know a family member who has lost their job .
We try to assure them that everything is going to be OK and that it is normal for them to feel depressed. '

Velasquez tries to help her some of her callers find the resources that can improve their employment situation , at times referring them to specific job training or job search sites .

And she and every other worker at this center want people to know , no matter how desperate and broke , that they can afford therapy .

As Velasquez points a caller to psychological help , one therapist is listed as costing between zero and $ 30 a session , depending on need .
Another psychologist costs from $ 25 to $ 90 .

The screen reads out the list of issues the therapists at clinics deal with , 'child abuse , divorce , adult survivors of incest , family violence. '

Velasquez wishes Lupoe , the man who killed his family and himself in Wilmington , had called her .

' We would have intervened, ' says Velasquez , who also has a masters ' degree .
' We would have sent a clinician out there right away , within an hour , even sooner .
And we would have to contact law enforcement to help us .
Especially if he 's at the point of telling us at that time he would try to do something. '

The phone rings again .
Velasquez , Gore and others start their duty of soothing tortured souls .

Often it 's as simple as getting someone to agree to lying down on a therapist 's couch , so they wo n't soon lie down in a casket .
