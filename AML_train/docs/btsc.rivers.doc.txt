Behind the Scenes: Chilled by words of hatred - CNN.com
YOGYAKARTA , Indonesia ( CNN ) -- I thought it was a joke when I first got the e-mail .
CNN 's Jakarta producer contacted me to say that the recently captured Indonesian terrorist suspect , Abu Dujana , was willing to do an interview .
I felt like saying 'Yes , well let 's see if Osama 's available too , and we can see if we can get them on Larry King as a double act. '

But she insisted the police had sanctioned a face-to-face meeting with Jemaah Islamiyah 's military commander , at a secret location somewhere in Java .
We scrambled to the airport and less than 24 hours later I found myself nervously pacing up and down an empty , echoing corridor of a police building , waiting for a convoy carrying the most dangerous terrorist in Southeast Asia .

He appeared in silhouette initially .
He was dressed in white and flanked by armed plainclothes police officers .
As he approached I could see a slightly built , wiry man , who looked younger than the 37 years old police said he was .

He smiled as the officers took off his handcuffs .
I was alarmed at the apparently lax security .
The door was a few feet away and there was no one guarding it .
I thought for a moment that he might make a run for it .

But he did n't .
He seemed resigned now to his fate .
He is facing the death penalty if convicted on terrorism charges .

The police think Abu Dujana was involved in some way with just about every major terrorist attack in Indonesia in the last five years , rising through the ranks of Jemaah Islamiyah to become the pre-eminent military commander .

He is a veteran of Afghan terrorist training camps and even boasts he once met Osama Bin Laden .

Our interview was conducted in a conference room .
As the camera crew made final adjustments to the shot , I tried to make small talk with the alleged mass murderer sitting in front of me .

It was difficult .
What do you chat about with someone who has dedicated their life to an organization that believes in indiscriminate mass murder ?
The weather ?
The price of rice ?
The latest football results ?

In the end , I explained that he could talk in Indonesian , but my questions would be in English , that he should look at me , not the translator and that he should try to stay still in his chair .

He seemed affable , but had piercing brown eyes .
He exuded a calm disdain for me .
A gentle , inner mocking resonated from his face , which frequently cracked into a broad smile .
He spoke softly and with obvious intelligence .

He was careful not to implicate himself directly in any attacks , claiming they were carried out by a splinter cell , which had become alienated from Jemaah Islamiyah .

But on broader philosophical questions , he was unremittingly nihilistic .
He believes in the utter supremacy of Sharia law , and that hard-line Islamic rules should be imposed on everyone , regardless of the faith .

Abu Dujana sees Americans as legitimate targets , because of the United States intervention in Iraq and backing of Israel .
He laughed as he said I , too , was a legitimate target simply for being British .
He seemed unconcerned about his own life or those of his wife and children , saying God would make the only judgment that mattered .

After 40 minutes , I was getting increasingly irritated by his fascistic nonsense and he too was also growing weary with reciting dogmatic answers .
He said he had to pray , and the interview ended .

He was led away to a small office to face Mecca .
I waited in the corridor outside .
When his conversation with God over , he was handcuffed and gently escorted to a waiting car , leaving me chilled by his words of hatred -- words that were often said with a smile .
