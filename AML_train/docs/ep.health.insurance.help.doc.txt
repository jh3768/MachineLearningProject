No health insurance? Get help here  - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- Dr. John Di Saia was playing baseball with his son a few weeks ago , and just as he rounded second base , he tumbled to the ground , breaking his fall with his elbow .

' Guess I should n't have been running in flip-flops, ' says Di Saia .
At first he did n't think much of the injury , but as it became more painful , he showed it to a colleague , who told him he 'd ruptured his triceps tendon .
' He said I needed surgery immediately. '

One problem : Di Saia , a plastic surgeon in San Clemente , California , did n't have health insurance ; he 'd ended one policy a few weeks before and was about to start a new one .
' It 's pretty embarrasing when you 're a physician and you say you do n't have health insurance .
They think you 're some kind of an idiot, ' he says .

Once he got over the embarrassment , Di Saia buckled down and negotiated with doctors and the outpatient clinic to get the price for his surgery cut in half , from $ 4,800 to $ 2,400 .
While he says he was clearly at an advantage being a doctor , he thinks everyone can -- and should -- negotiate health care costs if they do n't have insurance .

' You should always ask .
Why would n't you try ?
' he says .

Negotiating with doctors and hospitals is just one thing you have to learn how to do when your insurance disappears , says Steve Luptak , executive director of an assistance group called Healthcare Advocacy .
' I 've had so many people who 've just been laid off coming to me for help because they 've lost their insurance .
They 're so stressed , they 're so depressed , they feel like it 's the end of the world, ' he says .
' But there are things you can do .
It 's not a futile situation, ' he says .

If you want to try to get new , affordable insurance , or find programs that offer you financial help for doctor 's visits , prescription drugs and more , follow these steps :

Step 1 : Get good advice

When you get laid off and lose your health insurance , you may need someone in your corner .
Several places specialize in helping people find new , affordable insurance and free care :

Step 2 : Search for affordable insurance

With advice from experts at the groups above , begin your search for affordable insurance .
Start with COBRA , which means you continue with your employer 's insurance , except now you 're paying the entire premium on your own .
You can learn about COBRA at the Department of Labor 's Web site .

If you ca n't afford to go on COBRA , you 're in good company ; a recent study by the Commonwealth Fund found that only nine percent of people who are offered COBRA actually use it .
Sometimes it 's less expensive to buy your own insurance policy rather than going on COBRA .
