HONG KONG , China ( CNN ) -- It is said that nowhere else on earth will the impacts of climate change be felt more acutely than in the developing world .

And within the developing world , no-one else will be more vulnerable to these changes than the rural dweller .

More than 3 billion people live in the rural areas of the developing world ; amongst them three quarters of the world 's poorest , and three quarters of the world 's hungry .
There are many problems they face , but with relation to climate change the key problems are pretty fundamental : where they live and how they live .

According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , the weather-related impacts of climate change will largely be played out in the lower latitude regions of the world , where much of the world 's rural poor live .

In these areas , communities , particularly ones that are built around coastal areas and the delta regions , will be faced with more droughts and floods and increasingly erratic weather patterns .
In addition to causing widespread damage to people and their properties , these weather disruptions will profoundly impact food production levels .

The livelihoods of the rural poor tend to be based around one sector : Agriculture .
The developing world is full of farming communities -- 60 percent of India 's population depends on subsistence farming , for example , while 87 percent of the world 's 400 million small farms are in China .

Communities like these depend heavily on local resources -- forests , fisheries , agriculture and livestock .
And it is their reliance on climate-sensitive resources , such as local water supplies which make them even more vulnerable .
Any changes to land quality , water supplies or fuel sources will be felt the quickest in these areas .

Just not getting IT

Compounding the problem for the people living in these communities is access to information and technology - or lack of it .
Gaining access to the rural communities of the developing world is no easy task .

According to the UN System Network on Rural Development and Food Security , more than 850 million people in the developing world 'are excluded from a wide range of information and knowledge. '

And according to the UN 's Food and Agricultural Organization ( FAO ) , there are twice as many non-school going children in rural areas compared to their urban peers .

The rural poor are overall the most cut-off from the media and new technologies , which is not surprising when you consider four out of five people living without electricity come from rural areas of the Third World .

What this means - aside from the obvious effects of a lack of education - is that when disasters do strike these communities are the least equipped to prepare for them , and the least prepared to react to them , because they do n't have the infrastructure .
But it also means that it takes longer to get the message out that something 's happened .

Financing additional aid

There has been much talk on financing adaptation funds to help the developing world cope with the changes climate change will bring .
In total , the estimates of how much the international community needs to spend annually on adaptation programs overall is near $ 50 billion , says Oxfam , but others disagree .

The World Bank puts the amount at anywhere between $ 10 billion and $ 40 billion , while both Christian Aid and the UN Development Program put the figure nearer $ 100 billion .

With aid from the G8 countries falling over time instead of increasing , Oxfam believes that unless something changes now , international adaptation aid will be short by $ 30bn of what was originally promised .

While there has been much talk of increasing international aid to help agricultural development in these parts of the world , Oxfam says aid levels have instead been decreasing over the years .

In the mid-80 's , 17 percent of international aid was spent on agriculture ; by 2001 it had plunged to 8 percent , Oxfam says .

In predominantly rural Sub-Saharan Africa , where arguably it needs more assistance than most other parts of the world , international aid for agricultural projects slumped by 43 percent during the 1990 's .

Population growth means more pressure on food supplies

While the aim of the international community - through the Millennium Development Goals - is to halve global hunger by 2015 , in the last 10 years the numbers of the world 's hungry have grown by another 54 million , now totaling 854 million .

As a region , sub-Saharan Africa feels it more than most , as it is home to more than 200 million of these hungry people ; it 's numbers having increased by 20 percent in the last decade , says Oxfam .

Overall an additional 132 million people are expected to join this group worldwide by 2050 , says The International Fund for Agricultural Development ( IFAD ) , but by 2080 the UN believes hunger or malnutrition could be affecting an extra 600 million of us .

Because of the expected population growth - the vast majority of which will happen in the developing world - in the next 25 years , the human race will need 50 percent more cereal and 85 percent more meat to sustain expected demands .

Farmers across Africa now face the prospect that suitable farm land will shrink , as will the length of growing seasons , and crop yields will tumble .
One quarter of a billion rural dwellers in poor African countries now also face severe water shortages by 2020 , which in addition to its obvious human impacts will prove disastrous for food production .

Oxfam warns that the continent 's agricultural production will be 'severely compromised ' moving forward .

A half a billion hectares of its crop land have already become degraded , with rain-fed agriculture production levels in some African countries predicted to fall by as much as 50 percent , reports the Population Reference Bureau .

This is particularly bad news for the region -- around 95 percent of the entire region 's cropland is rain-fed .
In Central and South Asia , crop yields are predicted to fall by 30 percent , and 1 billion of its people will also be hit by the loss of freshwater sources .

Migration can compound the problems

Investing in agricultural aid does n't just help poor farmers do their jobs .
A failure to extend sufficient support could bring disastrous effects not just for these rural communities but for the surrounding regions and even beyond .
The reason : Migration .

When faced with issues like failed crops , flooded land , water shortages , creeping desertification -- as will be an issue in parts of Latin America -- the obvious thing these people will do is move .

The latest estimates of the total number of climate change refugees that the world can now expect to see by 2050 is 250 million people .
These people will come from the developing world , and it is likely that most of them will come from these rural communities .

The developing world has already suffered disproportionately from climate change-related disasters : Between 2000 and 2004 , of the 260 million people a year affected by climate change disasters , a staggering 98 percent of them lived in the developing world , according to the UN 's latest Human Development Report .
Moving forward they are being warned that they face more of the same .
