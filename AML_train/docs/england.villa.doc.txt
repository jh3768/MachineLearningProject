Villa held as Stoke claim improbable draw  - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- Aston Villa wasted a chance to strengthen their Champions League qualification claims as they were held to a 2-2 draw by relegation strugglers Stoke City on Sunday .

Villa looked to be coasting to victory after fine strikes by Stilian Petrov and John Carew put them 2-0 ahead , but Stoke hit back with two goals in the last three minutes .

First Ryan Shawcross headed home for his first of the season before substitute Glen Whelan hammered home a last-gasp injury-time equalizer for a precious point although Stoke remain in the bottom three and have not won away all season .

Villa could have gone eight points clear of fifth-placed Arsenal with victory at Villa Park and stepped up the challenge to Liverpool and Chelsea immediately above them , but had only themselves to blame .

Petrov put Villa ahead with an emphatic strike for his second of the season just before the interval and had a hand in Carew 's first time effort which sailed in with 10 minutes left .

In other action on Sunday , West Ham moved up to seventh with a 1-0 win over Manchester City whose problems away from home continued .

Hammers record buy Savio Nsereko came off the bench for the injured Valon Behrami and it was his run and shot which helped to tee up Jack Collison for a well-taken winner on 71 minutes .

Earlier , City 's record buy Robinho had missed a good chance after being set up by Craig Bellamy and his fellow Brazilian Elano clipped the post with a late effort .

At the other end of the table , Blackburn moved out of the bottom three with a crucial 2-1 win at fellow relegation battlers Hull City .

Stephen Warnock and Keith Andrews struck within the space of three minutes at the end of the first half for Blackburn/

Iain Ashbee pulled one back for Hull late on but their recent slump after a fine start to the season continues .

Bolton also gave themselves more breathing space in the battle against the drop as they beat fellow strugglers Newcastle 1-0 .

Second half substitute Ricardo Gardner scored with his first touch of the game for the home side , who move to 10th in the congested English standings .

Newcastle , who had strong penalty appeals turned away when JLloyd Samuel blocked Fabricio Coloccini 's effort , remain 15th , two points above the drop zone .
