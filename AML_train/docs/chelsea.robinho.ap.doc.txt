Deco is Scolari's first Chelsea signing - CNN.com
MADRID , Spain ( AP ) -- Portugal midfield player Deco has become Premier League Chelsea 's first signing since Portugal coach Luiz Felipe Scolari was appointed manager during the European Championship .

Scolari was able to lure Deco despite interest from Jose Mourinho at Inter Milan , but Chelsea could lose midfielder Frank Lampard , who has been linked with a reunification with Mourinho at the San Siro .

' It is good for me to be here and first of all I am very happy to be here, ' the 30-year-old Deco said .
' I know it is a new challenge but I am looking forward to it .

' I know I need a little bit of time to adapt bit but I am sure I will adapt quite well and quite fast and do my best for the team. '

Deco was shown on Chelsea 's Web site signing the contract with chief executive Peter Kenyon , although details of it were n't initially disclosed .

The player had two years left on his contract with Barcelona , but new coach Pep Guardiola said last week that the Brazil-born midfielder was not part of his plans for next season .

He was barely known in Brazil and was even released by local club Corinthians before venturing into small Portuguese clubs Alverca and Salgueiro .

It was there he attracted the attention of top clubs , eventually moving to Porto and Barcelona .

He won the European Champions League with both Porto and Barcelona , and becomes part of the latest attempt by the Blues to claim first European Cup title .

' I am sure I have come at the right time to do great things and be able to help Chelsea go back to the way it was , and come back to being the first one , not only in England but also to win the Champions League that has been their dream for so long, ' he said .

' The Premier League is a great league and it is getting better and you can see that with the Champions League Final , where you had two English teams .

' It is great that we have so many great players here at Chelsea and it is great that there is the competition which is healthy for everybody and this just makes the team better. '

Plagued by injuries , Deco scored only one goal in 28 matches with Barcelona last season .
He was among several players jeered by fans in the team 's last home appearance in the Spanish league .

Deco said it was his 'worst season ' with the club and was allowed to negotiate with other teams .

He was part of the Portuguese squad that reached the Euro 2004 final on home soil , losing to Greece .
He also helped Portugal reach the 2006 World Cup semifinals , when they lost to France .

But at Euro 2008 , the pre-tournament favorites lost to Germany 3-2 in the quarterfinals .

Real Madrid 's Robinho could follow Deco to Stamford Bridge according to Spanish media reports .

The Brazil forward 's agent met with Chelsea sporting director Frank Arnesen in London in May and reportedly learned that Scolari , who was leading Portugal into the European Championship at the time , was keen on getting Robinho .

Robinho is under contract with the two-time defending Spanish champions through 2010 , but has been linked with Chelsea and Manchester United .

Former France captain Lilian Thuram and striker Santi Ezquerro will be looking for new clubs after their Barcelona contracts ended Monday .

Thuram , who regularly came off the bench for the Catalans in his second season at the Camp Nou , saw an expected move to Paris St. Germain fall through after a routine medical detected a heart condition .

The 36-year-old Thuram retired from international football this year .

Ezquerro had been little used since joining from Athletic Bilbao three years ago , with eight goals in 39 appearances .
