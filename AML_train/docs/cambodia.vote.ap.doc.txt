Hun Sen looks to victory in Cambodia vote - CNN.com
PHNOM PENH , Cambodia ( AP ) -- Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen 's ruling party has claimed a landslide victory in parliamentary elections .

The vote is expected to usher in yet another term for the former Khmer Rouge soldier who has ruled for 23 years .

Khieu Kahnarith , spokesman for the ruling Cambodia People 's Party , says estimates from party agents at nationwide polling stations indicate the party could win more than two-thirds of the 123 seats in the lower house of parliament .

He told The Associated Press on Sunday : 'We can claim a landslide victory .
It is certain .
' Official results are expected later in the week .

Hun Sen 's reputation as a strongman who intimidates rivals has served him well , with voters rallying around the leader as Cambodian troops face off with Thai soldiers for a second week at a disputed 11th century Hindu temple .

Dressed in a gray safari shirt and pants , Hun Sen flashed a broad smile and displayed a black-inked forefinger to waiting cameras after casting his ballot Sunday in a provincial town outside the capital , Phnom Penh .
He declined comment to reporters .

Opposition leader Sam Rainsy called a midday news conference , demanding the polls be scrapped .
He claimed that some 200,000 registered voters in the capital , where the opposition is strongest , were unable to cast ballots because their names had been left off voter lists .

The ruling party 'is full of tricks .
Scrap the election and do it again, ' he said .
Allegations of vote fraud have plagued past Cambodian elections , but have never dented the ruling party 's dominance .

Hun Sen , 57 , Asia 's longest-serving leader , was expected to win the vote even before the military standoff escalated earlier this month .
But patriotic passions over Preah Vihear temple and Hun Sen 's firm stance against Thailand have swayed many undecided voters in his favor , analysts say .

' Everybody now supports the government because this is a national issue, ' said Kek Galabru , a prominent Cambodian human rights activist and election monitor .
' More people will vote for ( Hun Sen ) to give him more power to deal with Preah Vihear. '

Chan Sim , a 72-year-old voter in the capital , said he cast his ballot for Hun Sen 's ruling party 'because of its good leadership and ability to keep unity. '

More than 8 million of Cambodia 's 14 million people were eligible to vote in Sunday 's election .
Buddhist monks and ordinary people , some holding toddlers with milk bottles , crowded polling stations when they opened .

Eleven parties were vying for seats in the 123-seat National Assembly , the lower house of Parliament , with the winner forming a new government to run the country for the next five years .

Hun Sen has voiced little doubt that his ruling Cambodian People 's Party , which held 73 assembly seats during the past five-year term , will return with an overwhelming majority .

' I wish to state it very clearly this way : No one can defeat Hun Sen, ' the prime minister said earlier this year .

Hun Sen has ruled Cambodia since 1985 , when he became prime minister of a Vietnamese-installed communist government after the ouster of the Khmer Rouge .

Internationally , he has faced criticism for alleged corruption and human rights abuses .
But Hun Sen argues that his tenure has ushered in peace and stability after the Khmer Rouge 's genocidal reign in 1975-1979 , during which an estimated 1.7 million people died before it was toppled by an invading Vietnamese army .

A former Khmer Rouge soldier , Hun Sen has embraced free-market policies that have recently made Cambodia 's economy one of the fastest growing in Asia , expanding at 11 percent in each of the past three years .

The opposition Sam Rainsy Party , which held 24 seats in the lower house of Parliament , campaigned for greater attention to human rights , the country 's poor and an end to alleged government corruption .

Son Chhay , an opposition lawmaker , said an estimated 50 percent of Cambodians live on less than US $ 1 a day .

' Government corruption is the major thing .
We have to fight against it to make sure that the people receive a fair share of what the country is getting, ' he said .

But such standard election issues have been upstaged by the military standoff with Thailand .

The controversy revolves around 1.8 square miles ( 4.6 kilometers ) of land that has been in dispute since French colonialists withdrew from Cambodia in the 1950s .

The International Court of Justice awarded the temple site to Cambodia in 1962 , but anger flared in Thailand last month after Thai Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej backed Cambodia 's successful bid for the temple to be listed as a U.N. World Heritage Site .

Thailand sent troops to the border July 15 after Thai anti-government demonstrators assembled near the temple .
Cambodia responded by sending its own troops to the border .

The two countries plan to resume negotiations on the border row Monday .
Cambodia says it will renew a call for the U.N. Security Council to take up the issue if the talks fail again .
