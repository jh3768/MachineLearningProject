OutCast offers top-notch wireless sound - CNN.com
( CNET ) -- Soundcast Systems focuses its efforts on a very limited line of wireless audio products and it shows : the company consistently earns praise for its top-notch wireless sound quality .

Competitive pricing , however , is not Soundcast 's strong suit , and the OutCast is no exception .

This $ 700 weatherproof , wireless speaker setup is definitely not your average iPod speaker , but that 's a good thing .
It 's innovative , extremely easy to use , and offers great sound quality .

It could use some help in the looks department , though .

The Soundcast OutCast includes two main parts : the speaker unit and an iCast , which contains the wireless transmitter and acts as a base station for your iPod or other audio source .

The iCast is a rather compact and nondescript-looking device that 's shaped like a crescent moon lying face down and colored in computer white , muted gray , and a bit of neon green .
A cradle that fits any dock-connecting iPod is built into the top , while a port for attaching other audio sources is housed in the back .

Soundcast includes both an RCA-to-minijack cable and a minijack-to-minijack cable for connecting various devices .
There 's also a power input and a channel switch , which allows the iCast to transmit to one of three possible receivers .
One of these is the included speaker , but Soundcast also makes a couple standalone receivers that can be purchased separately .

The OutCast speaker unit is patently not compact , nor is it the most stylish piece of audio equipment we 've come across .
That 's not to say it 's ugly , per se ; rather , it has a nondescript look that will probably blend into most patio or garage settings nicely .
However , it showed dirt and scuff marks very easily after just one jaunt outside ( black would have been a better color option ) .
And we 'd be remiss if we failed to mention that several observers at our test site asked if it was a diaper genie .

Namely , the OutCast is huge ( it measures about 25-inches tall and 10-inches in diameter ) and cylindrical , and it weighs 40 pounds .
Thus , despite the fact that it 's battery operated , it 's not precisely portable ; in other words , you can move it from place to place if needed , but you probably wo n't want to do it often .

All this heft bodes well for durability , and also suggests that the OutCast is of the quality that the price tag implies .
Of course , the niftiest aspect of the OutCast 's design is its ability to be completely wireless and weatherproof .
Once you charge up the battery ( rated for 10 hours ) and close the port flaps , the speaker can withstand a healthy dose of wet while receiving wireless audio from the iCast , which can be up to 350 feet away , inside and out of the elements .

The OutCast features an array of buttons on the top , including play/pause and track shuttle keys that can be used to control an iPod docked in the iCast .
There are also power and volume buttons , as well as a key that controls a blue ambient light at the bottom of the speaker .

The OutCast can be used as a standalone speaker as well , though that takes away from its water-resistance , since the audio-in port must be uncovered in order to connect a source .

Setting up the OutCast could n't be simpler .
The first thing you 'll need to do is install the OutCast 's battery , which is a bit of a chore and requires a screwdriver , but it 's not a difficult process .

Then , just plop your iPod into the iCast , connect the power cable , make sure the iCast and OutCast are on the same channel , and hit play .
Music pumps out immediately .
The playback controls on the speaker work just fine , though the response delay increases the further the speaker is from the base .

The wireless performance in general is great : no hiccups from more than 100 feet away through several office walls .

The star of the show , though , is sound quality .
The OutCast features four 3-inch tweeters , which are arranged around the center of the speaker in order to output sound in all directions .
There 's also a 100-watt digital amplifier and an 8-inch downward firing subwoofer .
This means that music not only gets exceptionally loud , it also offers truly powerful bass--you can feel it thumping in your chest ( the true test of any good speaker , in our book ) .

Audio is expansive , encompassing , and clear--all things we expect from a unit in this price range .
If you 're looking for an easy way to port impressive wireless audio from your living room to your patio , the OutCast is an excellent choice .
