Former top Chinese official arrested  - CNN.com
BEIJING , China ( CNN ) -- China has arrested the former head of the country 's credit insurer on charges of corruption after a months-long investigation , state media reported .

Tang Ruoxin , former president of China Export and Credit Insurance Corp. , lost his job and Communist Party membership late last year for allegedly taking bribes , Xinhua news agency reported Thursday .

Tang was dismissed in April and arrested a few months later in August on suspicion of malfeasance .
The corruption charges follow months of investigation by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission ( CIRC ) -- a government supervisory body .
Tang remains under investigation , according to the CIRC .

The commission found that huge government assets were lost when Tang abused his power to benefit business connections .

Tang is accused of providing an unworthy credit guarantee for the Shanghai Hongsheng ( Norcent ) Technology Co. so it could get a $ 245 million bank loan , which the company later defaulted on .
He is also accused of taking kickbacks in the deal .

The China Export and Credit Insurance Corp. , founded in 2001 , is China 's only policy-oriented credit insurance company -- created after China joined the World Trade Organization .
It supports the country 's commodity , technology and service exports through export credit insurance .
Tang had served as its president and Communist Party Secretary since its inception in 2001 .

At an anti-corruption meeting held on Thursday , commission chairman Wu Dingfu said the fight against corruption should be strengthened to head off risks in the insurance sector .

Tang is the latest of many Communist Party and government officials accused of corruption .
President Hu Jintao and Communist Party leaders have vowed to prosecute violators .

But they admit that corruption within the party remains largely unchecked despite several high-level arrests , including Shanghai party boss , Chen Liangyu .

Chen was toppled in a scandal linked to the misuse of hundreds of millions of dollars in city pension funds , some of which were illicitly invested in dubious real estate and other projects .
He was the highest-level party official to be ousted in a decade .
