White House race heads into the unknown - CNN.com
By the time you read this , Barack Obama will probably have announced his running mate and John McCain will be about a week from naming his .

Then we enter the portal of the unknown into the fall campaign .

The one thing we do know is what will be the major themes of the candidates .
Regardless of the topic -- the economy , fuel prices , foreign policy -- the arguments boil down to bumper sticker language .

' McCain is Bush .
' 'Obama 's Not Ready .
' The fall campaign will play out variations of those two themes , and it begins in a place we did not expect .

In a year when absolutely every leading political indicator favors Democrats , the presidential race is dead even .
Barack Obama 's summer lead is gone .
The question is whether he has done something wrong or McCain has done something right .

Obama 's Democratic critics ( dismissed by the Obama crowd as 'beltway boo hoo-ers ' ) are , as one described it to me 'a bit ' concerned .
They think he has not been tough enough on McCain , nor detailed enough with voters , particularly the economically distressed working class , the 'Hillary voters' .

In short , they worry he 's being perceived as all speech and no specifics .

One Democratic governor complained on the front page of 'The New York Times ' that Obama needed to tell working-class voters what he will do for them in '10 words. '

Democratic insiders also concede McCain has done some damage with his famous 'Paris Hilton ad, ' depicting Obama as an empty celebrity with little experience to be president .

McCain took the chance to underscore his strengths when Russian troops moved into Georgia , offering daily statements on the situation while Obama vacationed .
( Obama did appear before cameras for one statement while he was in Hawaii .

McCain , after an early start even some of his staffers agree was rambling and stumbling , has gotten sharper and more aggressive on the stump .
His campaign has unleashed a string of attack ads and , most recently , was widely seen to have exceeded expectations at a faith and values forum .
Obama was criticized as 'too circular ' while McCain was praised for his directness .

Still , given the unpopularity of the Republicans and the historic low ratings of George W. Bush , McCain 's gravity-defying poll numbers are about more than a few tough ads and one badly timed vacation .
When voters see McCain , they do not see a Republican so much as a maverick ; not a party man so much as a pragmatic one .

And it has worked for him .
So far .

But if there is one thing we know as we approach the portal of the unknown : very little in this campaign has played out the way we expected it would .

It 's what makes it such a great year .
