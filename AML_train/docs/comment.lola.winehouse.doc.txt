Commentary: Whither Winehouse? - CNN.com
NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- It all had been going so well .
Amy Winehouse had made it to her gig at the Glastonbury Festival ( a feat , given her history of no-shows ) and she actually looked pulled together in her sequined minidress and sky-high Louboutin heels .

She even managed to remember her lyrics ( another feat ) , and for a moment some even allowed themselves to hope that this was the beginning of better days for the troubled singer .

Uh , wrong .

During her last song of the evening , 'Rehab, ' Winehouse descended into the crowd , singing to those in the front row .
Not a good idea .
Moments later she was elbowing and punching a fan .
The festival 's organizer , Michael Eavis , said Winehouse became violent only after an audience member groped her .
That may be true , but Winehouse has a history of doling out beatdowns .

In 2006 , she pummeled a fan who suggested that Winehouse had done wrong in picking the louche Blake Fielder-Civil for a husband .
' So I punched her right in the face -- which she was n't expecting , because girls do n't do that, ' Winehouse told London 's Daily Mail at the time .
Fielder-Civil received a knee to the crotch when he tried to calm her down .

' When I 've been on the booze recently , it 's turned me into a really nasty drunk, ' she added .

Winehouse and her beloved Blake also have traded blows .
One particularly nasty brawl left both bruised , bloodied and covered in scratches .
Again , she blamed the alcohol .

' I 'm either really a good drunk or I 'm an out-and-out s * * * , horrible , violent , abusive , emotional drunk, ' she told British tabloid The Sun .
' If [ Blake ] says one thing I do n't like , then I 'll chin him. '

In April , she was arrested after allegedly head-butting a man outside a bar in London .
His crime ?
He tried to hail her a cab .
She was held overnight for questioning , but no charges were filed .

There was a time when Winehouse 's wild antics seemed glamorous and subversive .
Listeners lapped up her tales of woe .
Radio played her music incessantly .
The fashion world swooned over her wino-chic look ( ratty behive , ridiculously kohl-rimmed eyes , tattered ballet flats ) .
And anyone attempting to telegraph cool and urbane aggressively name-checked the singer in conversation .

They were all justified .
Winehouse is a unique talent , blessed with one of the greatest voices of her generation .
None of this seems to matter to her .

Earlier this month , she was rushed to the hospital after fainting .
According to the singer 's father , cigarettes and crack have now left her with the early stages of emphysema .
Last month , a grainy video of Amy singing a racist nursery rhyme of her own creation surfaced .
She was dropped from the coming James Bond movie soundtrack .
A recent Rolling Stone profile paints her as a pathetic waif living in squalor .

A female artist felled by an abusive relationship , booze , drugs or some combination of the three is , sadly , nothing new .
Billie Holiday , Janis Joplin , Whitney Houston , and on and on .
Why Winehouse has n't viewed them all as cautionary tales and acted accordingly is beyond unfortunate .

This year , she managed to clean up rather nicely at the Grammys , delivering an impressive performance via satellite ( she was n't granted a visa to the U.S. because of her past troubles ) .
That evening she won five awards , including one for best new artist .
Winehouse should put down her dukes and get back to what she does best : singing .
