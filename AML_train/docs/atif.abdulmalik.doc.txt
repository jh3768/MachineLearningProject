Face Time with Atif Abdulmalik - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- Gulf investors steered clear of the deal to rescue the fifth largest U.S. Investment bank this week , over fears that U.S. investments could sink even lower .

But Atif Abdulmalik , CEO of global investment firm Arcapita , believes there are plenty of opportunities to be had .

Mr Abdulmalik , who presides over a company that has $ 3.8 billion in total assets , is not shying away from the US .

He talked to MME 's John Defterios ( JD ) about investing in the current global economic climate .

( JD ) : What sort of opportunities does this create for somebody like Arcapita , to see value in the market and to see nearly the end of a recession on the horizon ?

( AA ) : Well , John , it really depends on the sectors .
In the real estate sector there are good values now .
You have heard about some of the transactions being done lately .
Things are being bought at 40c to the dollar , 30c to the dollar so there are opportunities there .
The only issue you have now is that the banks are reluctant to lend .
We see this in private equity for example , valuations have shrunk , however , even with the availability of reasonable pricing the banks are still shying away from lending aggressively as they used to do before the sub-prime issues started .

( JD ) : It 's fair to say that this regional economy decoupled from the United States quite substantially growth wise ?
Is it time to decouple the currency as a result of the disparity between the slowdown and the explosive growth we are seeing here ?

( AA ) : Yes , you know from a self-interested point of view , the bank is really a dollar-based bank .
So we would rather see the dollar being pegged .
But from an economic point of view [ our currency ] should have been de-pegged a long time ago .
It 's really more a political issue of when to do it .
You saw we were in a conference today and you mentioned that growth is about eight percent in our area , however inflation is eating aggressively into all of this .
That 's because we are importing inflation by having all of our exports in dollars and most of our imports are in dollar denominated currencies .

( JD ) : What is the time frame then for this to take place ?
When political realities back off and economic realities take hold ?

( AA ) : Yes , again it 's really a timing issue within the political regimes in the area .
From an economic point of view it should have been done a long time ago .

( JD ) : We 've had two major governments or governmental regimes in the last two weeks put forward rules on sovereign wealth funds , asking for voluntary transparency measures .
The latest being the European Union .
Is this the compromise by the European saying it should be voluntary but we still welcome the capital ?

( AA ) : No , this sovereign wealth issue has been overplayed .
It started in the U.S. and the protectionism -- especially since it is election time now -- that 's a call that strikes very well with an uninformed kind of people .
I think more and more people are realizing that these sovereign wealth funds are as transparent as any other institutions and they truly are passive investors .

None of these people want to be on the board , they want to invest their excess wealth for the future generation of their countries in blue chip type investments .
And these investments they make are not a small hidden investment , they are very obvious , large substantial amounts and percentage ownership in large entities .
And all of this information is public information .
So this transparency word used for the sovereign fund I think is a little bit aggressive .

( JD ) : It 's interesting though to get specific about the European Union proposal .
They 're saying they want it voluntary not mandatory , it 's not going to be legislated .
Is this the compromise ?

( AA ) : You know , I do n't represent sovereign wealth funds .
We know them .
We deal with them .
We invest their money sometimes .
So , whether being voluntary is a good thing or not , I think it 's for the best interests of any economy to invite this money .
You do n't want to put too much restrictions to fend them off .
You should encourage them .
Take DP World , for example , that was not a good thing that took place .
If you want to attract money you ca n't put too many restrictions on it .

( JD ) : Arcapita owns a Northern Ireland utility , you recently sold a British utility then invested in US utilities .
Are you a big proponent of the future investment now being in infrastructure or related to infrastructure as a growth opportunity ?

( AA ) : Absolutely , you see this trend evident in everything , even in the big banks .
Infrastructure funds that have been raised lately are substantial .
They are all above $ 5 billion worth of funds and they are all targeted in this sector .
It 's the same way you saw conversions between hedge funds and private equity .
You 'll see a lot of conversions now between private equity and infrastructure investment .

( JD ) : Inflationary pressures are leading to some of the unrest we see in society today .
You sit on the Bahraini Economic Development Board .
How vital is it to get a hold or ahead of inflation before it becomes a real social issue ?

( AA ) : It 's very important , I think , not only you saw it with the locals you saw it with the expatriates as well , especially with the laborers brought from other countries to do the building -- whether it 's in Dubai , whether it 's in Bahrain --because inflation has eaten too much into their money .
They used to spend some and send close to half of it back home , now they can barely use all of it just to live , which is a sign that inflation is serious .
And the latest figures I have seen for Saudi and other countries here are a bit alarming .
So things have to be done to curtail inflation .
