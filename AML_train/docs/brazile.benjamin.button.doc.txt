( CNN ) -- There 's an old saying down in my hometown of New Orleans about how to tell the changing of the seasons .
I 'm not referring to winter , spring , summer or fall , but rather to the aroma of what someone 's cooking up fresh and delicious .

Shrimp , oysters , crabs , crayfish -- those are our seasons .
It 's all a cycle , and before we enter the Lenten season , we gather together to celebrate Mardi Gras .

The parades that began earlier this month wo n't end until late Fat Tuesday , February 24 .
This Sunday most of us will come home soon after the Bacchus float rolls down Canal Street , to watch the 81st annual Oscars and root for 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. '

' Benjamin Button ' is about transformation and renewal , and one of the film 's key characters is New Orleans .
Filmed in some of my hometown 's most cherished neighborhoods and historic sites -- the Garden and Warehouse districts , the French Quarter , Uptown and the shores of Lake Pontchartrain -- the diversity , spirit and special grace that imbibe the culture of New Orleans also enrich and inform the film .

While we celebrate the film 's 13 Oscar nominations , we should also celebrate its contribution to the rebirth of New Orleans and the surrounding Gulf Coast .

Based on a short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald , who chose Baltimore , Maryland , as its locale , the film version of 'Benjamin Button ' was instead set in New Orleans by Paramount Pictures .
Almost four years after Katrina , one of the most destructive and powerful hurricanes to hit our nation 's shores , the movie has ushered in a reawakening and refocusing on New Orleans that will help this treasured city move past the tragedy that almost destroyed it .

Like New Orleans itself , Benjamin Button was born old .
Literally. While other children played , young Benjamin sat as a wizened old man in a wheelchair among the old folks who accepted him for who he was , not how he looked -- unlike the widowed father who abandoned him to the care of a stranger , a black woman capable of loving Benjamin despite his grotesque appearance and infirmities .

Raised in a rest home , Benjamin grows younger as those around him age and die .
He meets the love of his life while both are in their tender years , though they do n't become romantically involved until their bodies and emotional maturity are compatibly developed .

As oblivious to his own good looks as he was to his initial ugliness , Benjamin has an innate appreciation for the values many young people typically take for granted -- physical labor , survival despite great obstacles , loyalty .

As Hurricane Katrina wheels itself ever closer to shore , its fierce winds and drenching rain pounding at the window , Benjamin 's story unfolds as his now-elderly childhood sweetheart lays dying , listening to her ( their ) daughter read from his diary , a journal neither had ever before read .

Just as New Orleans is loved and revered for its rich and unconventional cultural characteristics , the tragedy of Katrina has allowed a quixotic renewal -- a rebirth , if you will -- of New Orleans ' physical structure while maintaining a reverence for its spirit , historical architecture and traditions , so beautifully captured in the film .

People from all over the country embraced the displaced natives of the Big Easy with open arms until they were able to return home , much like Benjamin 's adoptive mother did .
Today , New Orleans has the look of a fresh young city complemented with a deep wisdom that only can be gained through near-death experiences .

' The Curious Case of Benjamin Button ' stands as an example of Hollywood 'doing right, ' both artistically and with a social consciousness that expended millions of dollars and created thousands of jobs in an area that desperately needs them .
This celebrated picture is a reminder to all that supporting American industry is the key to the rebirth of this incredible region .

The scars of New Orleans ' recent past are fading as she welcomes the future , dressed to the nines in fancy new lingerie and prepared for a romantic encounter with the future .
New Orleans is about redemption and renewal -- as is the most curious case of Benjamin Button .
