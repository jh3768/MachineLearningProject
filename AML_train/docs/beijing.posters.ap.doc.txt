Beijing covers up the gray - CNN.com
BEIJING , China ( AP ) -- The Chinese capital was shrouded in thick gray smog on Sunday , just 12 days before the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympic Games .
One expert warned that drastic measures enacted to cut vehicle and factory emissions in the city were no guarantee skies would be clear during competitions .

The pollution was among the worst seen in Beijing in the past month , despite traffic restrictions enacted a week ago that removed half of the city 's vehicles from roadways .

Visibility was a half mile in some places .
During the opening ceremony of the Athletes ' Village on Sunday , the housing complex was invisible from the nearby main Olympic Green .

' No , it does n't really look so good , but as I said , yesterday was better, ' said Gunilla Lindberg , an International Olympic Committee vice president from Sweden who is staying in the Athletes ' Village .
' The day I arrived , Tuesday , was awful. '

' We try to be hopeful .
Hopefully we are lucky during the games as we were with Atlanta , Athens and Barcelona, ' she added .

The city 's notoriously polluted air is one of the biggest questions hanging over the games , which begin on Aug. 8. On Sunday , temperatures of about 90 degrees , with 70 percent humidity and low winds , created a soupy mix of harmful chemicals , particulate matter and water vapor .

Athletes have been trickling into Beijing and were expected to begin arriving in large numbers this week -- though some were headed to South Korea , Japan and other places to avoid Beijing 's air for as long as possible .
Some Olympic delegations , including the U.S. Olympic Committee , are making protective masks available to their athletes .

The Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau said Sunday 's air was 'unhealthy for sensitive groups. '

The Chinese leadership consider the Beijing Olympics a matter of national prestige , and efforts to clean up the environment were part of its meticulous preparations for an event it hopes will dazzle the world .
Choking air pollution and visitors shocked at the environmental conditions would be an embarrassment for a government that wants to show itself is a modern nation .

' Hosting a successful Olympics and a Paralympics are now top priority of the country, ' Chinese President Hu Jintao said Saturday during a meeting with top Communist Party officials , the official Xinhua News Agency reported .

Du Shaozhong , deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau , blamed the thick haze on a combination of fog and light winds that were unable to blow away the pollution .

' Our job is to decrease the pollution as much as possible , but sometimes it is very common to have fog in Beijing at this time, ' Du said .

' The air quality in August will be good, ' he said .

Du noted that compared to days with the same weather conditions a year ago , pollution levels had decreased by 20 percent .
He did not give specifics .

Du was supported by Dr. Patrick Schamasch , an orthopedic surgeon who is the IOC 's medical and scientific director .
Schamasch said the IOC was monitoring Beijing 's air .
He said particulate matter on Sunday 'was a little bit higher than what 's expected but nothing dramatic. '

He said readings for ozone , carbon monoxide , sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide fell within 2005 guidelines set by the World Health Organization .

He did not disclose the exact levels , saying it was not the IOC 's practice .

' Today there is nothing critical preventing an athlete from running , except the visibility, ' he said .
' I can tell you it 's mist more than smog. '

Schamasch said conditions were 'not worse ' than in other cities that hosted the games , mentioning Los Angeles , Atlanta and Athens .

Beijing 's drastic pollution controls include pulling half the city 's 3.3 million vehicles off the roads , closing factories in the capital and a half-dozen surrounding provinces , and halting most construction .
Some 300,000 heavily polluting vehicles , such as aging industrial trucks , have been banned since July 1 .

Veerabhadran Ramanathan , an atmospheric scientist who is leading a study of the impact of Beijing 's pollution controls , said the direction and strength of the wind will be a main factor in whether the air will be clean during the Olympics .

' There 's only so much you can do with local emission reduction, ' he said .

Wind can blow pollution in from thousands of miles away .
Conversely , a lack of wind can create stagnant conditions in the city , allowing pollution to accumulate .

' I applaud the Chinese government for doing this locally , but the thing is , as scientists we all knew it may not make a major impact, ' said Ramanathan , of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California San Diego .
' You 're basically at the mercy of the winds. '

Jacques Rogge , president of the IOC , has warned that outdoor endurance events will be postponed if the air quality is poor .
The world 's greatest distance runner , Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia , has decided not to run the marathon because the city 's pollution irritates his breathing .
