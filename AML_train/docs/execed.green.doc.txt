Will businesses ditch green moves to survive the recession? - CNN.com
LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- As countries around the world plunge into recession , banks fail and companies go under , there are fears of another casualty amid the economic woes : Green business .

Many companies took advantage of the years of plenty to spend money on reducing their environmental impact .
A corporation was well and truly behind the times unless it had a team of analysts working away on methods to reduce its overall carbon footprint .

Now , however , this hangs in the balance as many companies concentrate on saving jobs , or simply staying in business .

Some world leaders are attempting to make sure that environmental measures are not ditched as businesses cut costs .
The $ 787 billion economic recovery plan unveiled recently by President Barack Obama included $ 100 billion in green measures , just under 13 percent of the total .
These include funding to improve building insulation , tax breaks for alternative energy companies and an expansion to urban rail networks .

One leading business school has pulled together its resources in double-quick time to consider green business and green values amid the downturn .

The seminar last week at Judge Business School , part of Cambridge University in the UK , gathered commercial bosses , government officials , academics and representatives from voluntary and pressure groups over two days .

Among those taking part were the CEO of the advertising giant WPP , the head of sustainability for the London 2012 Olympics and senior advisers to the UK government 's Department of Business .

Those gathered considered issues such as how to ensure ethical and environmental practices are continued in a recession , and how governments can help companies assist with a low-carbon economy .

Another discussion covered how markets affect environmental business and new business opportunities in the area .

The event was organized by the school 's Center for International Business and Management .
Dr Christos Pitelis , director of the center , said : 'The global financial crisis has revealed the fact that sustainability is not just an academic issue , it has real and far-reaching consequences for society .

' We need to learn from the financial dimensions of sustainability and change the way we do business , we need to start to value the environment .
Currently , we are creating a massive ecological debt by borrowing from the future at a rate that is unsustainable .

' We urgently need to combine business strategy with environmental regulation. '

Pitelis said he hoped the event would 'encourage dialogue and collaborative opportunities ' between commerce , government and other sectors .

On a wider level , are business schools shifting themselves away from the old cut-throat attitudes of the past following the banking crisis ?
One expert on ethics in the MBA world believes so .

Writing earlier this week , Aine Donovan , a business professor at Dartmouth College 's top-rated Tuck business school and head of the school 's Ethics Institute , said she had noticed a 'remarkable shift in focus ' among her students .

' The 'greed is good ' mantra is being seen for what it is : Reckless excess that leads to inevitable destruction, ' she wrote in an article for the magazine Newsday .
' If earlier classes were blind to the excesses of a consumer-driven society , this group can no longer claim ignorance of the harm that can occur. '

As business and banking corruption scandals came to light , she added , 'MBA programs across the country have aggressively infused business education with ethics training. '
