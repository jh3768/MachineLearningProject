LOS ANGELES , California ( AP ) -- Britney Spears is not yet fit to participate in court proceedings in her conservatorship case , her lawyer told a Los Angeles Superior Court commissioner Thursday .

Samuel Ingham , Spears ' court-appointed attorney , and attorneys for the pop star 's father and conservator , James Spears , spent 90 minutes in Commissioner Reva Goetz ' chambers .

Ingham told the court afterward that Spears ' medical condition is 'fluid ' because her treatment is changing .

Spears ' probate case is scheduled to go to trial July 31 , but Ingham said it could be 'harmful ' for her to participate .
Goetz agreed and said Spears ' diagnosis is not complete .

The 26-year-old singer and her estate have been under the conservatorship of her father for four months .
