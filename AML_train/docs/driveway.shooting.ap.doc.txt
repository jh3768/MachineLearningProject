Juror: Judge and jury pressured me to convict man - CNN.com
RIVERHEAD , New York ( AP ) -- A juror who helped convict a black man of fatally shooting a white teenager said he felt pressured by other jurors and the judge to change his vote to guilty during a marathon deliberating session .

The jury convicted John White of second-degree manslaughter Saturday in the August 2006 shooting of 17-year-old Daniel Cicciaro Jr .

White , 54 , remains free on bail and plans to appeal .
He faces a prison term of five to 15 years .

The case drew national attention after defense attorneys argued that he feared a 'lynch mob ' had come to attack his family when a group of angry white teenagers gathered outside his home .
The teens wanted to confront White 's son .

Juror Francois Larche , who is white , said he and another juror changed their votes after enduring 'a lot of psychological tactics ' from fellow jurors during an unusual weekend session ordered by the judge over jurors ' protests .

' It was a huge burden to bear, ' Larche , 46 , told the New York Post in Monday 's editions .
He added , 'I took a lot of heat. '

Jury forewoman Maureen Steigerwald denied that the judge , a 12-hour deliberating session on Saturday -- the fourth day of deliberations -- or the holidays played a role in the jury 's decision .

' The jury did a very careful , conscientious deliberate job, ' she told Newsday in Monday 's editions .

Judge Barbara Kahn said the jury would have to return on Sunday if they did n't reach a decision .
Larche told the Post the judge told them a mistrial would burden the families and the next jury .

' I thought about my family and the families of the other jurors, ' Larche said .
' It was not worth it in the end. '
