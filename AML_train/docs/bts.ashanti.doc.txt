Behind the Scenes: Star's bloody stunt flopped - CNN.com

CNN 's Lola Ogunnaike writes about a troubling e-mail she recently received .

NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- I received a really disturbing e-mail the other afternoon .

' Do you know the person pictured in the following video, ' it read .
' If so , please contact me immediately .
Your life might be in danger .
' The sender claimed to be a Detective James Nicholas , Director of Crime Prevention for the Universal Crime Network .

It 's not everyday that I get death threats , so naturally I freaked , clicked on the link and up popped a news report about a series of copycat murders that had been inspired by the R&amp ; B singer Ashanti 's video 'The Way That I Love You, ' a song about a woman who discovers her boyfriend has been unfaithful .

Clutching a butcher knife and dressed in beaded gown , she cries and croons about betrayal .
The cheater ends up dead in bathtub .

Jealous lovers , according to the report , were on a rampage -- and the next victim , it suggested , would be me .
On the wall of one of the crime scenes were the words 'Lola Will Die, ' written in what appeared to be blood .

Yikes .

Turns out the entire thing was a hoax , a publicity stunt created to help Ashanti sell her latest album , 'The Declaration .
' Visitors to her Web site were invited to fill out a 'gotcha-gram ' questionnaire , which would allow one to personalize the news report .
The target would receive an ominous e-mail from a 'detective ' and the name scrawled in blood at the fictional crime scene would be theirs .

It 's a great stunt if you 're pushing a slasher flick , but is n't R&amp ; B music supposed to be about love and romance and not serial killings ?

Amid protests , Ashanti 's record label Universal Music shut down the 'gotcha-gram ' portion of her Web site Wednesday .
When I asked the label about the 'gotcha-grams ' earlier this week they issued a terse 'no comment ' and directed me to an article in which Ashanti said the grams were a better alternative to actual violence .

She once called the grams 'an incredible online viral tool .
' She 's since changed her tune .

' Following discussions with Ashanti , we have jointly decided to remove the TheWayThatILoveYou.com website that hosts the Gotchagram, ' read a statement from the singer 's label .
' Ashanti and her music have always been about self-empowerment and addressing the issues that are most meaningful to her .
We stand by our artist and her creative choices. '

That Ashanti would have to resort to lame PR stunts to sell records is as much an indictment of her label as it is of the singer .
In recent years , hip-hop and R&amp ; B have been synonymous with violence , but she has n't .
Even as the sole female member of the rap collective Murder Inc. , she was always more good girl than gangster moll .
Sullying her act in the hopes that it would translate into album sales did n't work .
Not all press is good press .

Since its release last week , 80,000 copies of 'The Declaration ' have been sold .
A respectable number , but a far cry from the 400,000 albums her debut sold in its first week six years ago .

Back then Ashanti and Beyonce were in lockstep for R&amp ; B princess supremacy .
Beyonce 's career has since soared into the stratosphere .
She 's currently No .
4 on Forbes ' Celebrity Power 100 list ( right behind Oprah and Angelina Jolie ) .

Ashanti is not on the list .
She 's also had to eat the dust of veterans like Mary J. Blige and upstarts like Rhianna and Keyshia Cole .

Here 's one way to salvage her career and generate positive buzz : A killer second single .
