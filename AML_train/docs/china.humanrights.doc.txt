China rebuffs human rights report - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- China has rejected a new report which claims it has broken a promise to improve its human rights situation and 'betrayed the core values of the Olympics. '

The report by Amnesty International , entitled The Olympics Countdown : Broken Promises , was released Tuesday and outlines particular areas of concern including the death penalty , detention without trial , the persecution of rights activists and the lack of media freedom .

According to Amnesty , China promised an improvement in human rights , media freedom and better provision in health and education .
Instead it says Beijing has locked up , put under house arrest and forcibly removed individuals they believe may threaten the image of 'stability ' and 'harmony ' they want to present to the world during next month 's games .

' By continuing to persecute and punish those who speak out for human rights , the Chinese authorities have lost sight of the promises they made when they were granted the Games seven years ago, ' Roseann Rife , Asia-Pacific Deputy Director at Amnesty International , said on the organization 's Web site .

However , China dismissed the report and said that people who 'understood ' China would not agree with it .

Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said : 'We hope Amnesty can take off the tinted glasses it has worn for many years and see China in an objective way. '

Elsewhere in the report , Amnesty welcomed China 's move last year to restore the Supreme People 's Court 's role in approving death sentences .
But it criticized the government , which says the number of executions has declined , for withholding data on death penalty cases .

International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) President , Jacques Rogge , recently claimed the IOC 's 'quiet diplomacy ' had led to several human rights reforms in China , including new regulations for foreign media .

' We welcome the IOC 's recognition of its role on human rights , but given the current reality , we are surprised at their confidence that foreign media will be able to report freely and that there will be no internet censorship, ' said Roseann Rife .

Despite new media regulations that were supposed to allow for freer reporting for foreign journalists , Amnesty says they continue to be prevented from covering 'sensitive issues ' , including talking to those who suffer human rights violations .
It says foreign correspondents in China reported more than 250 instances of interference with their work since the start of last year .

The group also believes that local activists and journalists working on human rights issues in China are at particular risk of abuse during the Games .

One example given by Amnesty is housing rights activist Ye Guozhu , who continues to serve a four-year sentence for 'picking quarrels and stirring up trouble ' because of his opposition to the seizure and demolition of property to make way for new construction projects for next month 's games .

Ye Guozhu 's prison sentence was due to expire on 26 July .
Instead the Chinese authorities say , he will remain imprisoned until at least 1 October , after the end of the 2008 Olympic Games .
