Poll: Debate watchers say Obama wins - CNN.com
HEMPSTEAD , New York ( CNN ) -- A majority of debate watchers think Sen. Barack Obama won the third and final presidential debate , according to a national poll conducted right afterward .

Fifty-eight percent of debate watchers questioned in a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll said Democratic candidate Obama did the best job in the debate , with 31 percent saying Republican Sen. John McCain performed best .

The poll also suggests that debate watchers ' favorable opinion of Obama rose slightly during the debate , from 63 percent at the start to 66 percent at the end .
The poll indicates that McCain 's favorables dropped slightly , from 51 percent to 49 percent .

The economy was the dominant issue of the debate , and 59 percent of debate watchers polled said Obama would do a better job handling the economy , 24 points ahead of McCain .

During the debate , McCain attacked Obama 's stance on taxes , accusing Obama of seeking tax increases that would 'spread the wealth around .
' But by 15 points , 56 percent to 41 percent , debate watchers polled said Obama would do a better job on taxes .
By a 2-1 margin , 62 percent to 31 percent , debate watchers said Obama would do a better job on health care .

Eighty percent of debate watchers polled said McCain spent more time attacking his opponent , with seven percent saying Obama was more on the attack .
Fifty-four percent said McCain seemed more like a typical politician during the debate , with 35 percent saying Obama acted more like a typical politician .

' Independents tend to prefer debates that are dominated by substance and light on discussion of personal characteristics, ' said Keating Holland , CNN polling director .
' The perception that McCain attacked Obama gave red meat to GOP partisans , but it probably did n't help McCain with independents. '

' There was a notable gender gap as well, ' Holland said .
' Women thought Obama won the debate by a 62 percent to 28 percent margin .
Among men , Obama 's lead was narrower , 54 percent to 35 percent in Obama 's favor. '

During the debate , McCain demanded to know the full extent of Obama 's relationship with William Ayers , a 1960s radical .
But the poll suggests that line of attack may not resonate with Americans .
Fifty-one percent of debate watchers said Obama 's connection to Ayers did n't matter at all to them , with 23 percent saying it mattered a great deal .

The audience for the debate poll appeared to be a bit more Democratic -- and a bit more Republican -- than the U.S. population as a whole .
Forty percent of debate watchers in the survey were Democrats and 30 percent Republicans .

CNN 's estimate of the number of Democrats in the voting age population as a whole indicates the sample is about 3 to 4 points more Democratic than the population as a whole , but also about 2 to 3 points more Republican than the population as a whole .

Eighty-eight percent of Democrats questioned in the poll said Obama did the best job , with 68 percent of Republicans saying McCain performed best .
Among independents , 57 percent said Obama did the best job , with 31 percent backing McCain as the winner of the debate .

The post-debate polls do not reflect the views of all Americans .

The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll was conducted by telephone Wednesday night , with 620 adult Americans who watched the debate questioned .
The survey 's sampling error is plus or minus 4 percentage points .
