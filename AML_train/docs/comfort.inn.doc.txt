Travel Troubleshooter: Uncomfortable at the Comfort Inn - CNN.com
( Tribune Media Services ) -- Frank Gilbuena and his wife check in to a Comfort Inn , but find that they 're less than comfortable with their accommodations .
The upholstery is stained , the room is n't vacuumed and the bathroom is a mess .
He gives the hotel a day to clean things up , but it does n't .
Now he wants his money back , and the hotel is ignoring his letters .
What else can he do ?

Q : I recently had a disastrous stay at a Comfort Inn in Capitol Heights , Maryland .
When my wife and I checked in , we were given the keys to a room that was a mess .
The upholstery on the armchair was soiled , the ottoman was stained , the room had n't been vacuumed and the bathroom was n't clean .

Instead of requesting another room , I decided to give the staff an opportunity to clean up .
Why should I have expected another room to be in better condition ?
If they had such a room , why would n't they have given it to me in the first place ?

When we got back to our room the next evening , nothing had been done at all .
In addition to the mess we 'd seen the previous day , our soiled towels had been left in the room , new towels had not been supplied , and the room was still in shambles .

The hotel has a sign at the front desk that guarantees a refund if complaints ca n't be remedied satisfactorily and in a timely fashion .
I sent an e-mail to Comfort Inn about a month ago , but have n't received a response .
Am I wrong to expect minimum standards in a hotel room , like regular and thorough cleaning , fresh towels and comfortable furniture ?

A : No , that is n't asking too much .
Comfort Inn should have given you the keys to a comfortable room -- not one that the housekeepers apparently overlooked .

But when it did n't , you should have dropped the Mr. Nice Guy routine .
Instead of telling someone at the front desk that your room is n't acceptable , you should have asked for a clean room .
And if one was n't available , you should have checked out .

I ca n't believe that you gave Comfort Inn an entire day to fix the problem .
That 's incredibly generous of you , and the only thing more surprising than that is that the property did n't fix the problem .
I mean , how hard is it to send a housekeeper up there to vacuum and change out the towels ?

Invoking the '100 Percent Satisfaction Guarantee ' offered by Comfort Inn was n't a bad idea , but it was too little , too late .
The policy is not as cut-and-dried as you make it sound .
' If you are not satisfied with your accommodations or our service , please advise the front desk of a problem right away and give them an opportunity to correct the situation, ' it says .
' If the hotel staff is unable to satisfy you , they may give you up to one night 's free stay. '

The operative word here is : 'may .
' And leaving the hotel before the problem is addressed makes a successful resolution less likely , at least in my experience .

I think certain inconveniences at a hotel can be temporarily overlooked .
For example , if your shower is n't stocked with soap and shampoo or the remote control on the TV does n't work , that 's something you can give the hotel a little time to take care of .

But there are other things that no hotel guest should have to tolerate , not even for a minute .
A filthy room is one of them .
You were far too accommodating to the Comfort Inn , and you waited too long to get things resolved .
Patience -- at least in this case -- is not a virtue .

I contacted the hotel on your behalf .
A company representative phoned you promptly , apologized for the unsatisfactory experience and offered a full refund .
