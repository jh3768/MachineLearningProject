( CNN ) -- You know , it may be we have been looking at the economic picture all wrong .

The notion that perhaps things really are n't so awful as all that popped into our heads today when we heard the CEO of Merrill Lynch was putting in for a $ 10 million bonus for 2008 -- mostly because , in 2008 , he adeptly held Merrill Lynch down to a loss of only $ 11.67 billion .

Now , put it in context .
This was at a time when Wall Street rivals like Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns collapsed entirely .

John Thain is the CEO we are talking about , and he also argued he was able to arrange the sale of Merrill Lynch to Bank of America during these troubled times .
And that orchestrating the sale of an outfit that had lost more than $ 11 billion surely ought to be worth some big bonus cash .

One of my neighbors worked for Merrill Lynch , and she recently got laid off .

Literally thousands of Merrill employees are likely to be let go because of the sale to Bank of America .
And the CEO wants a $ 10-million bonus .

Is it me or is this guy nuts ?

This was all front page news in The Wall Street Journal today , and because of that , I 'm guessing , by late this afternoon Mr. Thain came to his senses and withdrew his bonus request .
iReport.com : How is the automaker crisis affecting you ?

Being publicly hung out to dry can be quite a motivator .

Look , Mr. Thain may well have inherited a mess of a company .

He may have done an admirable job of limiting the losses and he may be paying for the mistakes of his predecessors .

But that 's life .

That is the world we all now live in and newsflash , Mr. Thain , we are all now paying for the mistakes of Wall Street big shots like your predecessors .

Every single tax-paying American .

We are glad you came to your senses because in this current environment there is no possible way to justify a request like this .
