King on walkoff: 'I have seen it all now' - CNN.com
ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) -- It was a moment tailor-made for live television : The plastic surgeon who operated on Kanye West 's mother agrees to talk to Larry King but then walks off the set almost as soon as the interview starts .

The bizarre turn of events had even CNN 's King scratching his head .
In his 50-plus years in broadcasting , King has never had a guest agree to appear but then disappear while still on the air .

' It was as crazy a night as you can imagine, ' King said Wednesday from New York .
' I have seen it all now. '

The interview-that-never-was almost did n't even begin .
As showtime arrived Tuesday night , Dr. Jan Adams -- who arrived late at the CNN studio due to airline delays -- told King 's producers that he had received a letter from West 's family .
Adams said the family was asking him not to go on the air .

So , after the show had begun , Adams came on to the set -- to say he would not be doing the show .

' I 'm going to respect their wishes, ' Adams told King .
' And I 'm going to apologize to you , because I think I 'm taking up your airtime , but I will not be on the show. '

And then Adams pulled out his earpiece , disconnected his microphone and stood up .

King recalled the moment he realized his guest was walking off .

' I was thinking , 'This is n't happening ... I see it , but I do n't believe it, ' ' King said .

' I have had fires in the studio .
I have had people fight .
I have had people hit each other on the set ... punch each other, ' he added .
But this was a first .

The interview with King was supposed to be the plastic surgeon 's first on-air interview since the death of Donda West , the 58-year-old mother of the hip-hop star .

West died November 10 after she was found unresponsive and in respiratory distress at her home , the Los Angeles County coroner 's office said .
Her funeral was held Tuesday in Spencer , Oklahoma .

CNN entertainment correspondent Lola Ogunnaike was backstage at the King show .
She and others were expecting to appear briefly later in the program to discuss the Donda West case .

And then Adams walked off the set .

' We were all stunned, ' Ogunnaike said Wednesday .
' We had no idea that was going to happen. '

Ogunnaike said she was particularly surprised because Adams has spoken about the case in the past .

She said the letter from West 's family apparently gave the plastic surgeon pause .
' I think this letter really spooked him, ' Ogunnaike said .

Wendy Walker , senior executive producer of 'Larry King Live, ' said the turn of events was 'almost like being in a fire drill. '

Show staffers were already on edge as travel delays threatened to scrub Adams ' appearance , Walker said .
But then , just minutes before airtime , word came that the surgeon was in the building .

' There was a huge sigh of relief, ' Walker said .
' And then all of a sudden I hear he 's not doing the show. '

Walker said she asked Adams if he could appear on the show and explain why he would be unable to discuss the case .
He agreed .

' We did n't know how long he was going to stay, ' Walker said .
' But we certainly did n't think he would take his earpiece off and walk out. '

King said Adams was courteous despite his abrupt about-face on the air .

' He hung around for the whole show, ' King said .
' And at the end of the show , he hugged me. '

Adams did tell King that he would 'make it up ' to him .

Walker said Adams 'really wanted to do the show .
He really wanted to answer the questions .
And we are hoping that he will come back at some point. '

CNN will rebroadcast the program Saturday at 9 p.m. ET .

Summing up Tuesday evening 's show and its surprising twists , King said : 'All you can do is all you can do .
The only way you can act is the only way you can act. '

' Technically , nothing happened last night ' to shed light on the Donda West case , King said .
' But it was n't dull. '
