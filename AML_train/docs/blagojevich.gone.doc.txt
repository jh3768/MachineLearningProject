Blagojevich's name, image removed from state Capitol - CNN.com
SPRINGFIELD , Illinois ( CNN ) -- Workers at the Illinois Capitol building wasted little time Thursday night changing the face of state government , shortly after Gov .
Pat Quinn replaced the ousted Rod Blagojevich .

The Illinois Senate voted 59-0 on Thursday to remove Blagojevich from office .
Moments later , the Illinois Senate voted unanimously to prevent Blagojevich from ever holding political office in the state again .

After the Senate vote , the 'welcome ' sign with Blagojevich 's face , which visitors saw as they entered the Capitol in Springfield , was quickly brought down .

Maintenance crews arrived , first removing the gold nameplate with Blagojevich 's name .
Using drills and a ladder , they then brought down the 5-foot-high sign to make the official change .

Workers also removed the former governor 's official state picture positioned atop a state outline and a silhouette of Abraham Lincoln .

' Was that quick enough ?
' one worker said to laughter .

An employee standing nearby as the picture was taken away said , 'Do we need someone to throw a shoe ? '

Moments later , the picture of Quinn was placed where Blagojevich 's picture used to be .

Blagojevich , who was elected governor twice after terms as a U.S. representative and state lawmaker , was arrested on federal corruption charges in December .

Federal authorities allege , among other things , that Blagojevich was trying to sell the Senate seat that became vacant after Barack Obama was elected president .

During the impeachment trial 's closing arguments , Blagojevich appeared before the senators , saying he had done 'absolutely nothing wrong. '
