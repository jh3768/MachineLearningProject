United 'untouchable' admits Arsenal's Wenger - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger says Manchester United 'look untouchable ' as they bid to take a stranglehold on the Premier League title race at home to Fulham .

England striker Wayne Rooney returns on the bench after a seven-match injury absence on Wednesday when Alex Ferguson 's United are expected to go five points clear of nearest challengers Liverpool .

Wenger 's Arsenal would be a massive 15 points off the pace in fifth place behind Aston Villa and Chelsea -- and fighting to finish among the Champions League places .

Croatia striker Eduardo scored twice on his return after a year out as Arsenal overwhelmed Cardiff 4-0 in Monday 's FA Cup fourth-round replay win to stay on course for a Wembley final .

' We are on a very strong run at the moment and we have promised to give everything until the last day of the season but at the moment Manchester United look untouchable, ' admitted Wenger .

' They are 12 points ahead of us and they have a game against Fulham which they will certainly win. '

United face Tottenham in the League Cup final on March 1 ; are also still involved in the FA Cup and like Arsenal , Liverpool and Chelsea resume Champions League action in next week 's first knockout stage .

Wenger says Arsenal 's 'basic target ' is a first four Premier League finish that will guarantee more highly-lucrative top European action next season , while Ferguson has also juggled his playing resources .

As well as Rooney -- he has finally shaken off a hamstring problem -- United recall Rio Ferdinand , Nemanja Vidic , Carlos Tevez , Michael Carrick and Dimitar Berbatov following the weekend FA Cup win at Derby .

' The plan is for Wayne Rooney to be involved tomorrow night and he will start on the bench, ' Ferguson told Key103 .

' We have handled him in the right way .
The decision not to involve him on Sunday was a good one because he was able to train and that extra day has brought him on a lot. '

Goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar looks to achieve a staggering 14th consecutive Premiership clean sheet , against a side yet to win an away league game this season .
