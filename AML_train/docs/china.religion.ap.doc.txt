China accused of religious persecution - CNN.com
WASHINGTON ( AP ) -- The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom submits its annual report to the State Department Friday , including a list of nations it says should be treated as the world 's worst persecutors .

At a news conference Thursday on Capitol Hill , commissioners Nina Shea and the Reverend Richard Land left little doubt that they believe China and North Korea should be on that list .

Shea said the Chinese government harasses and detains Christians , Muslims , Tibetan Buddhists and Falun Gong practitioners .
Land said China also sends Christian refugees back to North Korea , where they can face torture and execution .

Members of Congress at the news conference said China has disgraced itself in advance of this summer 's Beijing Olympics , and several urged President Bush to cancel his plans to attend the opening ceremony .
