Chavez: Interpol report a 'clown show' - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- Colombia did not alter computer files that it claims show Venezuelan support for a leftist rebel group , the international police organization Interpol said Thursday .

But Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez dismissed the findings from an Interpol report as 'a clown show ' and ridiculed Interpol secretary general Ronald Noble as 'a tremendous actor. '

Chavez issued the statement after Interpol concluded that Colombia did not modify computer files that were seized during a raid of a leftist rebel camp in March .

The items were seized during Colombia 's March 1 raid on a rebel camp in Ecuador occupied by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia , or FARC .
The raid killed 25 people , including Raul Reyes , second-in-command of FARC , who is thought to have owned the files .

Colombian President Alvaro Uribe says the files contain evidence that Venezuela and Ecuador were supporting the rebels .

Chavez denies the allegations and claims that Colombia tampered with the files to fabricate evidence of a link between Venezuela and FARC .
He also accused Interpol of trying to give 'the clown show the character of scientific seriousness. '

But Interpol announced Thursday that a forensic analysis of the three laptop computers , three USB drives and two external hard disks indicated that the files had not been modified since Colombia took possession of them .

Interpol said it did not examine the files for content .
But Interpol Secretary General Ronald Noble , whom Chavez called a 'gringo ' policeman and 'a tremendous actor, ' said the organization is 'absolutely certain ' that the materials came from a FARC camp .

In an interview with CNN en Espanol on Thursday , Noble refused to comment on the content of the files .
But he hailed the files as the largest collection of records in the world concerning FARC , one that would help other countries learn about the group 's inner workings .

Since Colombia obtained the files , it has presented them as evidence that Venezuela and Ecuador have supported the rebels , who have waged a long and complex battle against the Colombian government for control of the country .

The United States , which considers FARC a terrorist organization , has access to the computers ' information and is conducting its own analysis , a spokesman for the U.S. State Department said Thursday .

Colombia 's top police officer said in early March that documents taken from the computers showed that Chavez had given $ 300 million to FARC .

Venezuela denied that claim .
Ecuador , too , has lashed out at the accusations and accused Colombia of trying to use the files to justify the March 1 attack .

' This smear campaign has been illustrated by the famous episode with the computer , which supposedly connected us with FARC, ' said Rafael Correa , Ecuador 's president .

The attack provoked a regional crisis , leading Ecuador and Venezuela to send troops to their borders with Colombia and denounce the attack as an infringement on Ecuador 's sovereignty .

The results are likely to further strain relations between the United States and Venezuela , which enjoy major trade ties despite significant political and ideological differences .

Venezuela gets 31 percent of its imports from the United States , making the U.S. its largest trading partner .
The country sends 46 percent of its exports to the United States , according to the CIA .

If the United States were to declare Venezuela a supporter of terrorism , it could affect travel and trade between the two countries .

The findings are also likely to cause more tension among Venezuela , Ecuador and Colombia , a key Washington ally .

The United States and several global humanitarian agencies believe FARC has kidnapped hundreds of people and hidden them in the Colombian jungle , including former presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt .

' Colombia faces a hostile and anti-American neighbor in Venezuela , where the region has forged an alliance with Cuba , collaborated with FARC terrorists and provided sanctuary to FARC units, ' President Bush told the Council of the Americas on May 7 .
