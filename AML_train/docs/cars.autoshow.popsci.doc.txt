Behind the scenes at the Detroit auto show - CNN.com
( PopSci.com ) -- Things are a teensy bit weird here in Detroit .
It 's a cross between Wacky Wednesday and Alice in Wonderland : Nothing is as it should be , and some things are downright trippy .

Aside from the weather , which veered from drearily lukewarm and rainy to all snow and freezing wind , the true delirium began when you stepped inside .

Within the main halls at Cobo Conference/Exhibition Center , guarded by a 15-foot-tall statue of boxing champ Joe Louis , things have taken a turn for the surreal .
Consider :

In what will certainly become known as one of the great ironies in automotive history , progressive , tech-obsessed Toyota burped out a gigantic , cast-iron pickup truck as its main offering , and embattled dinosaur General Motors won giddy raves for its startlingly visionary Volt plug-in sequential-hybrid concept car .
( But since Toyota is expected to surpass GM this year as the world 's largest car manufacturer , this cosmic flip-flop sort of makes sense .

Chinese manufacturer Changfeng presented , with no apparent irony , a bright-orange concept car called the Rhombus that looks like a Le Car that 's missing a chromosome .
It features a bamboo interior , shag carpeting , an awkwardly stair-stepped hood and trunk , and wheels not at the four corners but in a cross shape running down the middle of the car .
There 's no conceivable benefit to this .

Automotive-racing tycoon , trucking-company founder and veteran car salesman Roger Penske -- a dude who oozes macho from every pore -- has taken up the wee-little-car cause and become the designated importer for the distinctly un-Hummer-like Smart ForTwo , coming here in early 2008 after many years of corporate agonizing over whether the American market actually wants microcars .
Maybe Penske will start racing the little buggers .

Legendary singer Seal was on the Audi dais to perform , you guessed it , 'Crazy ' before going on about how much he loved his Q7 SUV .

Indeed , even the press conferences themselves have become micro-theaters of the absurd .
It 's hard to even call them press conferences anymore , since they 've evolved , mostly through one-upmanship , into elaborate theatrical productions with Hollywood-caliber video intros , computerized lighting , bombastic music , lots of crew members walking around in headsets , and performers of every variety .
It 's like the manufacturers want to win not only Car of the Year but also a Tony , a Grammy and an Oscar .

At no time was this escalation more evident than when Mercedes-Benz answered the Audi/Seal performance minutes later by unveiling its new 4MATIC all-wheel-drive system with a flurry of performances on a big indoor skating rink built in Mercedes 's roomy display area .

First , real live sled dogs came out , dragging a guy in a sled .
Then came hockey players who seemed to be re-creating the mind-controlled ice-hockey scene from 'Strange Brew .
' Then a pair of elegant figure skaters floated out to inject a little sophistication into the whole affair .
Finally , two dozen 'photographers ' in skates came out acting as paparazzi to welcome 'Dancing with the Stars ' winners Emmitt Smith and Cheryl Burke , who were there for exactly seven seconds to unveil the Ocean Drive concept car .

Even the parts of these performances geared toward the actual delivery of information have become , well , performances .
Bad ones , too , because even though the production values are escalating , the talent in this area is decidedly not .

Witness the stilted deliveries from some of the worst teleprompter readers on Earth : automotive executives .
It 's easy to understand why the German and Japanese execs would struggle with these readings -- and they do , mightily -- but even old pros like GM head Bob Lutz , Chrysler CEO Tom LaSorda , and most of the guys at Ford ( smooth honcho Bill Ford being the only exception ) struggle to get through them and still retain some semblance of cool .

That , however , is a modest complaint compared with the overall bluster of these conferences , which also included Jeep 's hapless effort at crowd participation , in which the company handed out bongos to 8,000 journalists and implored them to let their inner artists out , as some real talents on stage banged their drums .

It 's one thing to have fun with your new cars and entertain the assembled journos with a little soft-shoe ( last year Mitsubishi presented some terrific Japanese drummers ) , and it 's perfectly fine to jack up the production values with high-concept displays .
But it 's another thing altogether when showmanship overtakes the cars themselves and the genius that went into them .

Tell us the story , please -- we want to hear about awesome cars and how they were created .
If we want Cirque du Soleil , we 'll go to Vegas .
( Thanks for the bongo , though !

As for the cars themselves , well ... launch the gallery and have a look for yourself .
