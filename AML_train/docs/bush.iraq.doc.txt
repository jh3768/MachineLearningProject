Bush sees progress, but speaks of 'frustration' with Iraq's leadership - CNN.com
MONTEBELLO , Quebec ( CNN ) -- President Bush acknowledged a mood of 'frustration ' hanging over Iraq 's fractious , paralyzed government Tuesday .

But he stressed that it was up to Iraqis to replace their leadership .

Stymied by boycotts , bickering and bombings , the government of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki has been unable to take the political steps Iraqi and U.S. officials say are necessary to bring an end to the 4-year-old war .

The leaders of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee warned Monday that Iraqi leaders may be facing their 'last chance ' to hold the government together .
The panel 's chairman , Sen. Carl Levin called on Iraq 's parliament to vote al-Maliki 's 'non-functioning ' government out of office when it returns in two weeks .

Speaking at a news conference in Canada where he was meeting with the leaders of Canada and Mexico , Bush said Iraqi leaders had made some progress .
But he said the government has 'got to do more. '

' The Iraqi people made a great step toward reconciliation when they passed the most modern constitution in the Middle East , and now their government 's got to perform .

' And I think there 's a certain level of frustration with the leadership in general , inability to work -- come together to get , for example , an oil revenue law passed or provincial elections, ' Bush said .

He said the 'fundamental question ' facing Iraqis is , 'Will the government respond to the demands of the people ? '

' If the government does n't demand -- or respond to the demands of the people , they will replace the government, ' he said .
' That 's up to the Iraqis to make that decision , not American politicians. '

Levin said al-Maliki 's government was 'too beholden to religious and sectarian leaders ' to reach a political settlement of the country 's sectarian and insurgent violence .

But government spokesman Ali Dabbagh criticized Levin 's remarks , saying the Michigan Democrat had no right to criticize the Iraqi leader .

' The Iraqis will decide whether he will stay in the Cabinet or walk out, ' Dabbagh told CNN .
' We do respect the Iraqis ' final decision. '

He added , 'Being senator of the United States does not entitle him to talk about an elected prime minister in this way. '

Earlier Tuesday , the U.S. ambassador to Iraq , Ryan Crocker , told reporters that progress toward reconciliation measures has been 'extremely disappointing and frustrating to all concerned. '

Crocker and Gen. David Petraeus , the top U.S. commander in Iraq , are to report to Congress next month on the political and military progress in Iraq .

But Crocker told reporters in Baghdad that it will take time for 'meaningful reconciliation ' to filter from the country 's leadership to society at large .

' What has been happening in the last couple of years ... violence , population shift , displacement , tens of thousands of Iraqis killed .
We are not just going to overcome that in a few weeks. '

The government has been racked by walkouts during the current U.S.-led campaign to pacify Baghdad and its surrounding provinces -- a push aimed at buying time for al-Maliki and other Iraqi leaders to agree on plans to divide the country 's oil wealth , hold provincial elections and allow former Baath Party members back into public life .

Cabinet ministers representing the movement of Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr , and then members of Iraqi Accord Front , the Sunni bloc , left the government .
Last week , two Shiite and two Kurdish parties signed an agreement forming an alliance , an effort spurred on by the embattled al-Maliki .

Those groups -- al-Maliki 's Dawa party , the Shiite-led Supreme Islamic Council of Iraq , the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan , and the Kurdish Democratic Party -- are working to include a top Sunni party , the Iraqi Islamic Party , the major entity in the Accord Front .
