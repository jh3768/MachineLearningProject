( CNN ) -- All this week , we 're focusing on President Obama 's promise of transparency and accountability and to that end , we applaud his announcement today of a pay cap for corporate CEO 's taking bailout money .

But what we did n't hear anything about today -- as the president , Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner , and Press Secretary Robert Gibbs praised the virtues of the new rules -- was talk of penalties .
Real penalties for those who have mishandled the money and betrayed our trust .
Penalties for those who may mishandle our money in the future .

It 's one thing to freeze pay , it 's another to demand real accountability going forward .
We were n't the only ones scratching our heads after today 's announcement .
The question was raised at the White House news briefing :

Chuck Todd , NBC chief White House correspondent : 'That seems that the people the president called shameless last week are being allowed to go on honor system ?
What is the accountability ?
What is the teeth ?
What happens if they break rules ?
Do we yank the money back ?
Do we bankrupt the firms ?
Do we fire the executives ? '

Robert Gibbs , White House press secretary : 'I 'll get clarification from Treasury on that , but the beginning and end of these is n't just putting something on Web site. '

Beyond getting clarification from the Treasury Department , Press Secretary Robert Gibbs did n't really have an answer .
The White House argues putting a spotlight on the problem may be enough , but that just makes us wonder whether this is mostly a PR stunt .

Blowing bailout dollars on perks must be punished , just as if someone , or some company , committed tax fraud .
An 'honor system ' is simply not enough here , not after the abysmal behavior of some in corporate America after we already loaned them one-half of a $ 700 billion lifeline .

As the president himself points out , transparency must come with accountability .
We are still waiting to hear from him just what that means .
