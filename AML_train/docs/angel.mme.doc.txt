Face Time with Angel Gurria - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- While governments across the region grapple with the rising cost of food , groups like the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) are working to create strategies to address the problem .

Marketplace Middle East 's John Defterios ( JD ) sits down with secretary general of the OECD , Angel Gurria ( AG ) , and begins by asking him what can be done to combat rising consumer prices .

( AG ) : Clearly the problem is with all commodities - it 's with oil , it 's with metals , it 's with food and demand is coming from developing countries which are increasing their purchasing power .
But it is also coming from biofuels .
That means some of the food is being burnt instead of being eaten by animals , individually by people directly or indirectly .

Then of course there is also this demand in the markets where the commodities have become a store of value .
So , they substitute more traditional financial assets because people feel more comfortable and safer buying some futures of oil , metals or corns or soybeans or whatever than maybe buying a piece of debt .

( JD ) : It 's quite fascinating to watch the response from the Middle East .
Bar Saudi Arabia , the other central banks in the region do n't seem to have the monetary tools to deal with the challenge right now .
Is that a fair comment ?

( AG ) : The problem is that these countries import all these things and when these things suddenly double their value , clearly , there is going to be an impact on inflation .
At the same time these are developing countries .
It 's difficult to suddenly cut down on the projects , cut down on the infrastructure , etcetera because it 's badly needed , but they 're going to have to obviously take this into account .
Some of them as you say do not have the monetary tools and therefore can not respond by monetary policy by increasing interest rate , for example .

( JD ) : As you know on this program we talk about sovereign wealth funds because of the money coming out of the Middle East and the Gulf in particular .
The dialogue has improved .
Can you reach a common ground within the next six months on the general principles to move forward ?

( AG ) : The issue is too important to put a deadline on it , too important to be urgent , too important to rush it .
However , we divided the job a little bit and the IMF is working on the expected conduct from the wealth funds themselves , basically talking about some expected best practices , transparency , et cetera .
We should do better , I think the dialogue is getting better , it 's producing results .
The memorandum of understanding between the United States , Singapore , and the United Arab Emirates , of a few days ago was a good sign of this general direction .

( JD ) : One of the final challenges is the perennially low dollar which makes some of these assets look very cheap .
What 's going to lead to a substantial change in mind over a dollar that 's been weak for now three to four years ?

( AG ) : The dollar is doing what a currency from a country that has a deficit in their external accounts should be doing , which is weakening .
And that is helping to reduce the current account deficit of the United States .

( JD ) : If I can be Middle East specific here , a number of these currencies are linked to the dollar and they are growing very fast and the US is slowing down .
Is it time to break this link , the dollar link to the Gulf currencies , as a result of what we 're seeing in growth ?

( AG ) : Very frankly I think that if the oil was put into any other currency , then there would be an automatic adjustment and it would cost the same amount that it is costing today - in any currency in which you want to express it .
This is simply because what you have is a problem of supply and demand .

This is why it went up and this is the same reason why all the other commodities are going up .
Whether you choose to break the peg or not , really is not as important ; they 're basically oil-based economies and the oil is expressed in dollars but you can express it in any other currency ; it would simply have a different sign to it but the underlying value would be the same .
