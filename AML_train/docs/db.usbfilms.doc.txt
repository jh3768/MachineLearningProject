Can the USB go from computer dork to Hollywood player? - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- Foreseeing the future is a tricky business .
Why , for instance , should Hollywood moguls have paid much attention when the USB standard emerged in the mid-90 's ?

It simply made hooking computers to keyboards , printers and joysticks easier .

Nothing could seem further from their glitzy world .
How times change .

Now USB ports are to be found in $ 300 portable video players and $ 3,000 50-inch plasma HDTVs .

And they accept flash memory devices , which have undergone a revolution in storage capacity -- storing a dozen movies is not a problem .

So in retrospect it was only a matter of time before entrepreneurs tried out this idea : public kiosks that allow consumers to download movies directly onto a USB memory device , to be watched later on their portable video players , computers , or TVs .

Today an Irish startup called PortoMedia has tested the idea in some home markets , and a few U.S. trial cities are to be announced shortly .

Business is being lined up in 30-plus countries , it says , and the service works equally well in Tokyo or small-town India .
Its MoviePoint kiosk allows customers to download DVD-quality films in about 20 seconds onto its MovieKey , a USB memory device that costs between $ 20 and $ 100 , depending on the storage capacity ( from 2 to 15 movies ) .

The films are burned onto the MovieKey with the relevant license at the point of purchase , using Microsoft DRM ( digital rights management ) .

Consumers have several options on the licensing front .
Examples : the movie expires 48 hours from hitting Play , or you can play it three times within 30 days , or it never expires ( in which case you 've purchased it ) .

Now Hollywood is paying attention .
A number of major studios have agreed to let their movies be rented through MoviePoint kiosks , and investors in the startup include some big-name film execs .

Sticking it to old movie-watching habits ?

A 20-second download is fast , but changing habits takes time .

' Most consumers are used to browsing racks of the physical product , either on VHS or DVD, ' notes Marie Bloomfield , an analyst at Screen Digest .
' This is a more pertinent issue than the time it takes to deliver the content. '

PortoMedia might find encouragement -- or a threat -- in the rapid spread of DVD kiosks in the U.S. , most notably the Redbox kiosks found in McDonald 's , grocery stores and various retails locations .

These kiosks can hold several hundred titles , which cost about $ 1 per day to rent .
Downside : customers must physically return to disc ( though it can be to any kiosk , not just the one they rented from ) .

MoviePoint has some pros and cons compared to the DVD kiosks .
Most notably , it can hold far more titles -- thousands as opposed to hundreds .
And because it copies rather than dispenses these titles , there 's never a problem with running out of stock .

' Think about the how much more responsive the content offerings can be if an obscure movie , for example , becomes really popular -- like the 'Napoleon Dynamite ' phenomenon from a few years ago, ' notes Kurt Scherf , principal analyst at Parks Associates .

Another plus with MoviePoint is there 's no need to return a movie , and no chance of late fees .

For someone in transit -- at the airport , for instance -- this is a real convenience .
And travelers in general face the problem of video-rental stores requiring membership and a local address .

In the trials in Ireland , the ability to delay the rental period was one of the most popular features : the movie might expire 48 hours after you first hit Play , but when you first hit Play is up to you .

For retailers , kiosks using hard drives means not having to worry about packaging and shipping costs , as with physical DVDs .
And of course the kiosks take up little space , which makes more room for other products .

' We used to have mom-and-pop video stores , and they got wiped out by the big chain video stores, ' notes Kim Gregson , a communications professor at Ithaca College in New York .

' Now mom and pop can compete in terms of variety and quality without sacrificing too much floor space in a small store. '

Competing against other formats

There is also a new generation of DVD-burning kiosks allowing titles to be burned onto disc .
These kiosks have the advantage of churning out something familiar : the DVD .
Drugstore giant Walgreen is going with this approach for selling movies .

But MoviePoint works much faster : about 20 seconds compared to about 15 minutes .

On the down side , MoviePoint requires consumers to purchase extra hardware just to use it .
They must buy the MovieKey .
And if they want to connect it to a regular TV -- usually lacking a USB port -- they 'll also have to buy a special dock ( called MovieVault ) .

Compare that to the simplicity of just buying a DVD .

' If this thing is perceived as being even the slightest bit complex , it is likely doomed, ' believes Russ Crupnick , senior industry analyst for The NPD Group , a market research firm .
' More consumers will likely prefer a disc. '

MoviePoint probably has its best shot among early-adopters types who like being the first to try out new things .
In the trials in Ireland , the MovieKey 'became something to show off to their friends -- cool and simple, ' according to PortoMedia spokesperson Jacintha O'Donohoe .

Early adopters 'can spread the word about the speed of download , as well as the quality and variety of the movies , to the later adopters, ' suggests Gregson .

But she still thinks converting the later adopters will be a challenge given all the competition .
This competition includes , for starters : DVD rentals at stores and kiosks , cable TV 's video-on-demand , discs by mail as with Netflix , and cheap DVD purchases at places like Wal-Mart .
Then there are the slightly more tech offerings .

Downloading movies has n't really taken off yet , but these include online services like iTunes and Net-connected game consoles like the Xbox .

And then , of course , the iPod must be considered .
It also uses the USB standard , of course .
iPods seems perfectly suited for MoviePoint concept .
They 're familiar , widespread and can play video .

But , sadly for PortoMedia , they are 'not compatible with any third-party digital content solution, ' notes Bloomfield .

' Given that Apple accounts for a sizeable chunk of the video handheld market , that reduces the addressable market considerably. '

Of course , Apple might spread into the USB kiosk market on its own .

' But whether it would be interested in doing so is another matter entirely, ' says Bloomfield .

The company is doing just fine with iTunes , and Apple TV , which links downloaded content to regular TVs , has been made easier to use since its first release .

For PortoMedia and its backers , the competition , and the pros and cons of its system ( the list goes on and on ) , are all familiar .

But for now , at least , the startup is in the spotlight of both Hollywood and Silicon Valley .

Its MoviePoint kiosk is a bit like a new film on the verge of global release : Whether it flops , attracts a cult following , or hits the big time remains to be seen .

Only one thing is certain at this point : Hollywood is no longer ignoring that boring old USB specification .
