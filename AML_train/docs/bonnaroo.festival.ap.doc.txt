Bonnaroo helps bring festivals back from the dead - CNN.com
( AP ) -- When the tens of thousands of music-crazy fans gather in the Tennessee countryside this weekend for Bonnaroo , they 'll be part of not just one of the summer 's biggest music festival , but a nationwide revival .

Just 10 years ago , after the disastrous 1999 Woodstock and the temporary petering out of Lollapalooza , festivals appeared dead .
But in recent years , they 've emerged as one of the music industry 's few cash cows in an otherwise tumultuous environment .

Of course , braving heat , rain storms and traffic can make most any festival a tumultuous experience .
But the rejuvenation of the summer festival is best understood as a reflection of changed music-listening habits .

' I do n't think it 's a coincidence that as people started having more access to music , it meant that people were looking for a live experience that reflected that ability to consume, ' said Rick Farman , a founder of the Bonnaroo Music &amp ; Arts Festival , which launched in 2002 .
' When you look at people 's iPods , it 's really diverse what people are listening to. '

Like hitting 'shuffle, ' fans can toggle through genres at a large festival with multiple stages .
This year 's four-day Bonnaroo , which starts Thursday , has more than 100 acts .
It 's held each year on a 700-acre site in Manchester , Tennessee .

Though the festival , produced by Superfly Productions and AC Entertainment , began primarily as a jam-band event , its identity has broadened considerably .
This year 's fest will welcome Pearl Jam , Kanye West , Metallica and Chris Rock .

It 's hardly the only gig this summer .
The season kicked off with the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio , California. , a nine-year old summer behemoth that in many ways originated the festival revival .

Still to come is the seven-year-old Austin City Limits Music Festival in Texas and the now Chicago-based Lollapalooza .
Each has a giant lineup of dozens of acts .
Lollapalooza will feature Radiohead , Rage Against the Machine and West ; Austin City Limits will include Beck , Foo Fighters , Gnarls Barkley and David Byrne .

That still leaves the third-annual Pitchfork Music Festival , put on by the influential Web site ; the first All Points West Music &amp ; Arts Festival in New Jersey ( created by Coachella producer Goldenvoice ) ; Seattle 's decades-old Bumbershoot ; the launch of Michigan 's jam band-centric Rothbury Music Festival ; the sponsored Virgin Festival in Baltimore ; and San Francisco 's new Outside Lands Festival .

There are many more , too , including the traveling Warped Tour featuring mainly punk acts , and the 10-city Rock the Bells hip-hop tour .

Older festivals are also adjusting to the new landscape .
In its 49th year , Rhode Island 's Newport Folk Festival will be produced by the Festival Network , which has diversified the historic Newport 's lineup .
Jimmy Buffett , Trey Anastasio , the Black Crowes and Cat Power will play where Bob Dylan famously plugged in his electric guitar in 1965 .

Jay Sweet , one of three producers of the Newport , says this is now 'a festival country. '

' That 's the business model right now, ' said Sweet .
' If you ca n't do it live , get out of the way. '

He believes that for a festival to thrive , it ca n't be limited by genre distinctions .

' We live in a genre-less musical paradigm, ' said Sweet .
' We are musical omnivores. '

The land rush for big summer stages has been a lucrative one .
According to concert industry trade Pollstar , Coachella grossed $ 16.3 million last year , Lollapalooza $ 9.8 million and Austin City Limits $ 11.3 million .

To make that kind of money , ticket prices are n't cheap .
Four-day passes to Bonnaroo , which include parking and camping , run from $ 209 to $ 244 , not including surcharges .
Like many festivals , Bonnaroo also offers VIP treatment ; $ 1,169.50 buys a pair of tickets with special facilities and snacks .
( For $ 4,000 at Coachella , you can get a posh tent with air conditioning and candles .

Farman believes providing more amenities to fans is central to the new festival experience .
At Bonnaroo , even yoga classes can be had for a price .

' We sort of had this concept that we could buck a lot of the negative trends in the industry , whether that was high ticket pricing , whether that was over-sponsorship , whether that was just not a lot of care being taken for the fans. '

Though terrific headaches can still be found -- maddening traffic and heat stroke among them -- the organization is clearly better than it used to be .

' Some of the festivals of the '90s were more about $ 5 waters or $ 8 waters and five port-a-johns per 2,000 people, ' said Sweat .
' I do n't think I 've stood in line at a port-a-john at any festival I 've been to in the last two years. '

Bands are also profiting .
Fees can range into the millions for the big headliners or still supply tens of thousands for less mainstream acts .

' For most bands , to be honest , if it 's a good paycheck , you want to go there, ' said Stephen Malkmus , the former Pavement frontman whose tour with the Jicks included a stop at Coachella .
' It can be an anchor for your tour , make it so you did n't lose money. '

Whether audience demand will match the increased supply of festivals is one of the big questions of the summer .
Ever-rising gas prices also could keep fans at home -- or at least at their local venue .

But anyone who truly wants to hit 'shuffle ' this summer will have to pick a festival and hop in the car .
