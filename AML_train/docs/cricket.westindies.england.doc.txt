Sarwan's 291 puts Windies on top - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- Ramnaresh Sarwan scored his best ever Test score of 291 to end England 's hopes of victory in the fourth test in Bridgetown , Barbados , as the West Indies ran up 749 for 9 in their first innings .

The islanders ' declaration late in the day , following an innings lasting more than 11 hours by Sarwan , left England facing the prospect of batting out a nervous final day to save the match and the series after themselves declaring at 600 for 6 in their first innings .

The tourists , who trail the series 1-0 with one Test to play , closed the day at 6 without loss , still 143 runs short of the West Indies ' total .

Starting the day on 184 not out , Sarwan moved quickly to his double century in just the sixth over of the morning , slashing James Anderson through the slips for four .

The bulk of the runs Sunday came in a 260-run sixth wicket partnership with wicketkeeper Denesh Ramdin , who was eventually picked off for 166 by Graeme Swan .
The spinner finished the innings as the pick of the England bowlers with 5 wickets for 165 .

The West Indies ' total was their third best in Test history , and the second-most runs England have conceded after the 751 for 5 the West Indies scored against them in 2004 .

Having bowled England out for just 51 in their second innings in the first test in Jamaica , Sarwan said the home side would be seeking to put the visitors under pressure early on the final day in search of a series-clinching victory .

' I do n't know if it will play on their minds -- but it will certainly be in our minds, ' he said , the UK 's Press Association reported .

' I hope we can come tomorrow , pick up some wickets and put them under early pressure .
It would be good to take that initiative in the first hour-and-a-half .

' We all saw what happened in the first Test in Jamaica , and the lead we have is very valuable to us .
The pitch has started to deteriorate ; a few balls kept a bit low , so we will have an interesting day ahead. '

The visitors ' Paul Collingwood admitted that England had begin the match with high hopes of leveling the series .

' Our goal was to come out here and win, ' Collingwood said .
' Some people from outside might have thought we would come here and win comfortably .

' But we know it 's always tough coming out to the West Indies .
They 're a tough side to crack .
When you have someone like Sarwan in the form of his life on a pitch like that , it 's not a great combination to be facing. '
