Working out may prevent drug and alcohol addiction  - CNN.com
WASHINGTON ( AP ) -- Sure , exercise is good for your waistline , your heart , your bones -- but might it also help prevent addiction to drugs or alcohol ?

There are some tantalizing clues that physical activity might spur changes in the brain to do just that .

Now the government is beginning a push for hard research to prove it .

This is not about getting average people to achieve the so-called runner 's high , a feat of pretty intense athletics .

Instead , the question is just how regular physical activity of varying intensity -- dancing , bicycling , swimming , tae kwan do -- might affect mood , academic performance , even the very reward systems in the brain that can get hijacked by substance abuse .

What first caught the attention of National Institute on Drug Abuse chief Dr. Nora Volkow : A study found tweens and teens who reported exercising daily were half as likely to smoke as their sedentary counterparts , and 40 percent less likely to experiment with marijuana .

Volkow knows -- from her own 6-mile daily runs and from her scientific experiments -- that the brain literally likes physical activity .
Exercise seems to invigorate neurochemicals that sense and reinforce pleasure .

' In children , it 's innate, ' she notes .
' Children want to move. '

But the nation 's children are becoming more sedentary , as illustrated by the obesity epidemic , 'screen time ' replacing outdoor play and a drop in school P.E .
And as youngsters approach adolescence , the run around the yard that used to be fun too often becomes a chore -- the dreaded jog around the school track or the nagging to get off the couch .
The sedentary teen turns into the sedentary adult .

' Why do we lose the ability to experience pleasure from physical activity ?
' asks Volkow .

Last week she brought more than 100 specialists in exercise and neurobiology to a two-day conference to explore physical activity 's potential in fighting substance abuse , and announced $ 4 million in new research grants to help .

Drug treatment programs often include exercise , partly to keep people distracted from their cravings , but there 's been little formal research on the effects .

The best evidence : Brown University took smokers to the gym three times a week and found adding the exercise to a smoking-cessation program doubled women 's chances of successfully kicking the habit .
The quitters who worked out got an extra benefit : They gained half as much weight as women who managed to quit without exercising , says lead researcher Dr. Bess Marcus .

She now is working with the YMCA on a larger , NIDA-funded study to prove the benefit .

Marcus cautions that people trying to kick an addiction have a powerful incentive to exercise .
Could that possibly translate into prevention ?
Among the clues :

-- Rats were less likely to ingest amphetamines if their cages had running wheels , suggesting exercise stimulated a reward pathway in the brain to leave them less vulnerable to the drug 's rush .

-- In people , exercise acts as a mild antidepressant and relieves stress .
Depression , anxiety and stress increase risk of alcoholism , smoking or drug abuse .

-- Volkow is intrigued that attention deficit disorder and obesity both involve problems with the brain chemical dopamine , one system that drugs hijack to create addiction .

-- Baby monkeys who do n't play enough in childhood have problems controlling aggression when they 're older .
The most aggressive tend to have defects involving the feel-good brain chemical serotonin -- and binge-drink when researchers offer them alcohol .

-- Back to rats , physical activity increases production of growth factors and stem cells in key brain regions important for learning and mood ; increases formation of blood vessels ; and strengthens communication networks between brain cells .

Together , that 's far too little research to know if exercise really matters for substance abuse , scientists at the National Institutes of Health meeting cautioned .

But , a few studies of school-age children suggest physical activity predicts better performance on math , verbal and other tests -- and better school performance in turn is linked to lower risk for substance abuse .

And getting sedentary seniors moving improves brain function -- research aimed at preventing dementia , not drug abuse , although the improvement is in an area that in younger people is linked to risky decision-making .

A caveat : If your own youth includes memories of parties with beer-guzzling athletes , well , the research concurs .
A major study that tracks adolescent risk behaviors found that by 12th grade , exercise offers no protection against binge-drinking .

' Now the kids who exercise the most actually drink the most, ' says Dr. Lloyd Johnston of the University of Michigan .
It may have to do with the celebratory nature of team sports , or getting revved for college -- or , other researchers suggested , even that competition is to blame .
