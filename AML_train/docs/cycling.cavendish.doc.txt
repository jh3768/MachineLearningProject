'Tired' Cavendish quits Tour de France - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- Tour de France sprint king Mark Cavendish has pulled out the race ahead of Sunday 's 15th stage -- the first in the Alps .

The 23-year-old has won four Tour stages , each time in a last-ditch sprint to the finish , becoming the first Briton in history to claim more than two victories in a single year .

As expected , he struggled during previous stages in the Pyrenees , and with the Tour moving to the high mountains , he has decided not to jeopardise his Olympic hopes next month by pushing himself through more misery .

After victories on stages five , eight , 12 and 13 , Cavendish was too tired to pull himself to the front of the peloton on Saturday and finished over three minutes behind sprint winner Oscar Freire .

' I 've done enough here with four stages, ' said Cavendish .
' I 'm a bit tired now .
I 've ridden one Grand Tour at the Giro .
Here I rode hard through the Pyrenees and was able to get a couple more results .

' Maybe if the green jersey was still in contention I 'd carry on , but I 'm 60 points behind now .
I think the green jersey is out of contention now so it 's better to go home and try and recover .
I 'll take a week 's rest , then I 'll start to concentrate on the Olympics. '

Cavendish will now set his sights on Beijing , where he will compete for Britain in track cycling 's Madison -- an event in which he is reigning world champion with Bradley Wiggins .
