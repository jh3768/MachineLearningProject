Speaking out for the survivors - CNN.com
NEW DELHI , India ( CNN ) -- Vimlendu Jha is the founder and head of Swechha -- We For Change Foundation which is based in India 's capital , New Delhi .

Swechha started out as an organization to combat the pollution of the city 's main waterway , the river Yamuna .
Today it deals with the environmental issues that affect several aspects of Delhi .

Vimlendu leads volunteers and local children to key sites around the city to tackle the ecological problems , as well as to raise awareness of the issues .
Follow his efforts in his blogs and video diaries .

March 6 , 2008 The park is situated on top of the metro station and is surrounded by big showrooms and food joints from all sides .

Suddenly , the visitors at the park found a number of college going students carrying placards , waving pamphlets , adjusting cameras , arranging exhibition slides and musical instruments .

No matter whether they knew each other or not -- mention Bhopal and there was an instant camaraderie .
This drew attention from hundreds of others who were visiting the park .
Soon , the place was bustling with more than 300 people for one cause : no more Bhopals .

Immediately , students got busy with preparing the stage .
Some put up the banners which said loud and clear 'Prime Minister walk your talk ' while others did a quick round of pamphleteering and appealed to people to join the candle vigil in solidarity for Bhopal .
Few others made sure that all things are easily available .
And sure they did manage to have a chaos free event !

The amphitheater soon became a live gallery .
Pictures of the disaster , ongoing contamination , children born with severe birth defects were laid on the ground along with pictures of peoples ' action across the world in support of Bhopal .

People began reading the slides first out of curiosity and then with the sheer realization of what Bhopalis have been suffering .
The look on their face said it all .
And a usually subdued amphitheater now echoed the sentiments of many who were shocked and bewildered at the government 's continued apathy .

We were also joined by a number of youngsters who had generally come for a stroll in the park .

They not only volunteered to distribute the pamphlets on the roads outside the park , but in fact read the whole pamphlet to be able to explain the matter to any one .
Many of them took our contacts and volunteered to organize Bhopal exhibitions in their colleges .

But most inspiring was the eagerness with which they joined us in our efforts .
They kept telling us : 'let us get together on this , let us take the issue to one and all ! '

The banner that we kept at the end of the exhibition was soon covered with messages to Prime Minister .
Hard hitting reactions !
But , the high point was when a very elderly person asked us 'when will you give it to the Prime Minister ?
Do n't forget to call me , I want to walk with you .
850 kilometers is no joke and that too second time ! '

After more than two hours or so we headed off , happy to know that we have given the government a shock , warned them that we are observing their stance on Bhopal closely and , informed people in Delhi how a government can force the old , sick and ailing to walk again .
This on the very first day of the Padyatra , they should expect more noise from us because we will not accept anything less than a fair deal for the survivors this time .
