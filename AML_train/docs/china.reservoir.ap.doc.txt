China: Last residents leave giant dam area - CNN.com
BEIJING , China ( AP ) -- Residents in the last township to be moved to make way for the rising waters of the Three Gorges Dam reservoir have been relocated , a state news agency reported Wednesday .

The emptying of Gaoyang town of Hubei province , part of a larger relocation plan , began in August 2004 and was completed Tuesday , Xinhua News Agency reported .
The government has moved nearly 1,000 households in the area in preparation for the rising water .

More than 1.4 million people have been relocated to allow for the water to rise behind the massive dam , the largest hydroelectric project in the world .

The dam , which has a 410-mile long reservoir , is supposed to end flooding along China 's Yangtze River and provide clean energy alternative to coal .

It is also expected to generate 84.7 billion kilowatts of electricity each year -- the amount of energy needed to light the counties of Los Angeles , San Francisco and Sacramento .

The water level in the reservoir was scheduled to reach its full height of 574 feet sometime next year , although the effects of silting and the area 's mountainous geography have prompted doubts about the exact level .

The $ 22 billion Three Gorges project has also raised ecological concerns , with residents in the area complaining about cracks in their walls , warped foundations and fissures snaking along the earth .

Pollution in the once fast-running river is building in the turbid reservoir .
Landslides -- common in the rainy region -- are occurring more frequently .
One in April in the Gaoyang area inundated homes and a primary school with rocks and mud .
