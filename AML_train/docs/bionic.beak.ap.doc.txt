Eagle to get second chance with 'bionic beak' - CNN.com
ST. MARIES , Idaho ( AP ) -- She has been named Beauty , though this eagle is anything but .

Part of Beauty 's beak was shot off several years ago , leaving her with a stump that is useless for hunting food .

A team of volunteers is working to attach an artificial beak to the disfigured bird , in an effort to keep her alive .

' For Beauty , it 's like using only one chopstick to eat .
It ca n't be done, ' said biologist Jane Fink Cantwell , who operates a raptor recovery center in this Idaho Panhandle town .

' She has trouble drinking .
She ca n't preen her feathers .
That 's all about to change. '

Cantwell has spent the past two years assembling a team to design and build an artificial beak .
They plan to attach it to Beauty this month .
With the beak , the 7-year-old bald eagle could live to the age of 50 , although not in the wild .

' She could not survive in the wild without human intervention, ' Cantwell said .

The 15-pound eagle was found in 2005 scrounging for food and slowly starving to death at a landfill in Alaska .
Most of her curved upper beak had been shot away , leaving her tongue and sinuses exposed .
She could not clutch or tear at food .

Beauty was taken to a bird recovery center in Anchorage , where she was hand-fed for two years while her caretakers waited in vain for a new beak to grow .

' They had exhausted their resources , and she would likely be euthanized, ' Cantwell said .

Beauty was taken to Cantwell 's Birds of Prey Northwest ranch in Idaho in 2007 after permits were obtained from the federal government .

Soon after , Cantwell met Nate Calvin during a speaking engagement in Boise .
Calvin , a mechanical engineer , offered to design an artificial beak .
A dentist , a veterinarian and other experts eventually volunteered to help .

Molds were made of the existing beak parts and scanned into a computer so the bionic beak could be created as accurately as possible .

' One side has much greater damage than the other, ' Cantwell said .
' It 's not as simple as a quick , snapped-off beak , 90 degrees and flush. '

The nylon-composite beak is light and durable , and will be glued onto the eagle .

The team decided against fastening the new beak with screws because the stump is so close to the brain and eye , Cantwell said .
But if the glue fails , screws will be tried , she said .

The artificial beak wo n't be strong enough to allow Beauty to cut and tear flesh from prey .
But it will help her to drink water and to grip and eat the food she is given .

Cantwell has been using forceps to feed Beauty , who is often treated to strips of salmon .

A successful attachment of a prosthetic beak is rare but not unprecedented , said Dr. Julia Ponder , executive director of The Raptor Center at the University of Minnesota .

' Not enough of these have been done out there to say , 'Yes , it can be done successfully, ' ' Ponder said .
' Whether or not it will be functional is a question. '

Dr. Erik Stauber of the nearby Washington State University veterinary hospital in Pullman does not have a lot of faith that the artificial beak will work .

' It 's a valiant effort to do something, ' he said .
' We have no experience with it. '

Although birds of prey are notoriously skittish around humans , Beauty has become somewhat comfortable with people .
She allows herself to be carried by Cantwell , and she tolerates the poking and prodding by those making the beak .

' She laid on the table for nearly two hours , fully conscious , knowing full well I was handling and restraining her , and never once trying to escape, ' Cantwell said .
' I suspect she knows we not trying to hurt her. '

Beauty has the potential to breed or be a foster mother for orphaned eagles .
Cantwell has other plans for Beauty as well .

' She 's a miracle recovery patient from her initial injuries, ' she said .
' She will be a huge educational tool , primarily to instruct people on why we should not shoot raptors and why they are beneficial to the environment .

' Give me an hour with a third- or sixth-grader , and they will never shoot a raptor. '

Shooting a bald eagle , though they are no longer on the endangered species list , remains a violation of federal law .
