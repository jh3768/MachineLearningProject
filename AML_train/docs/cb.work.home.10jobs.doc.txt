10 more jobs you can have at home - CNN.com
( CareerBuilder.com ) -- How would you like to work from home ?
No hustling out the door 10 minutes late , no fighting your road rage or battling for the last seat on train , no fast food lunch and no noisy co-workers .
Sounds like heaven does n't it ?

More than ever , workers are attracted to the 30-second commute , thanks to social and economic trends .
Technologies necessary for setting up a home office are widely available , relatively inexpensive and getting easier for people to use .
And more workers are seeking flexible schedules to care for aging parents and children .

Home-based working is growing rapidly , according to a 2004 survey by ITAC , the association for advancing work from anywhere .
The number of employed Americans who worked from home , from as little as 1 day a year to full time , grew from 41.3 million in 2003 to 44.4 million in 2004 .

Many people associate working from home with starting a home-based business and becoming an entrepreneur , but more and more employers are offering this option to workers in order to attract and retain top employees .
In fact , 7.6 million employees conduct work from home every month .

Do n't fret , there are jobs that you can find with established employers .
Even if the job is advertised as office-based , these positions are telework-friendly and could be in your future .

Administrative assistant Also known as virtual assistants , home-based administrative assistants use office experience and computer skills as support personnel .

Underwriters analyze insurance applications , calculate the risk of loss from policyholders , decide whether to issue the policy and establish appropriate premium rates .

They often design surveys , compile and evaluate the data and make recommendations to their client or employer based upon their findings .

Paralegal While lawyers assume ultimate responsibility for legal work , much of their work is delegated to paralegals .
Paralegals not only assist in preparation for closings , hearings , trials , and corporate meetings , they also perform a number of other vital functions including draft contracts , mortgages , separation agreements , trust instruments and may assist in preparing tax returns and planning estates .

If you want to make the case to a potential employer or your boss to let you work from home , keep a few things in mind .
If possible , provide concrete examples of how this arrangement was successful in the past or how it will succeed .

Suggest that you ease into it -- spending a few days to a few weeks in the office at the outset , meeting people and getting to know procedures .
Then , during the first three to six months on the new job , make frequent visits .
