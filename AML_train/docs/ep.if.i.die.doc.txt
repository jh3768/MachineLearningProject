If you get hit by a bus tomorrow  - CNN.com
Empowered Patient , a regular feature from CNN Medical News correspondent Elizabeth Cohen , helps put you in the driver 's seat when it comes to health care .

ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) -- Mark Balduzzi is n't old .
He is n't sick .
He is n't paranoid , either .
But he 's seen enough shootings , car accidents , and 52-car pile ups to know his life could end at any moment .

' Even though I think I have another 30 good years left , I know tomorrow I could get hit on the road by some nitwit, ' says Balduzzi , 50 , who was a police officer for 15 years and a paramedic for eight in New York and is now a health and safety consultant for the insurance industry .

That 's why he has all his ducks in a row : He 's filled out all the right forms so his wife can make medical and financial decisions for him in case he ca n't make them himself .

We do n't like to think about it , but any of us could get hit tomorrow by a nitwit .
So here , step by step , is what to do now to prepare .

Step 1 : Put crucial medical information in wallet and glove box

Imagine the crash scene .
It 's pandemonium .
The paramedics come and scoop you up off the pavement .
You 're unconscious , or maybe incoherent .
How will they know what medicines you 're taking and what medicines you 're allergic to ?
That information could save your life .

Write it all down on a medical information card .
Balduzzi has one downloadable for free here on his Web site .

Put the cards in your wallet -- Balduzzi has his in the see-through plastic section -- and in your glove box , and in anything else , like an appointment book , you carry around with you .
' Being redundant is a key part of preparedness, ' he says .

Step 2 : Put your 'in case of emergency ' numbers in wallet , glove box , cell phone

' I 've spent many hours digging through people 's wallets and going through cell phones looking for emergency contact numbers, ' says Denise King , president of the Emergency Nurses Association .

For the cell phone entries , Balduzzi once again recommends redundancy .
Emergency workers know to look for 'ICE ' which stands for 'In Case of Emergency .
' An 'AA ' will keep the number at the top of your contacts list .
' AA ICE ' or 'AA Emergency info ' or 'ICE spouse, ' are all good ideas for cell phone entries .

But the cell phone is n't enough , King says .
' When your car hits the tree at 50 mph , the cell phone goes flying, ' she says .
' The wallet you 're sitting on is much more likely to still be there. '

Step 3 : Appoint someone to make decisions for you

Do n't let your family wonder , or worse , argue over , who 's going to make life-and-death decisions for you .
Designate a specific person using a health care proxy form , also called a medical power of attorney or durable power of attorney .
You should have in your files a financial power of attorney form .
By conveying power of attorney , you give a specific person legal authority to make property , financial and other legal decisions for you in .

For example , Marie Deveney , a trust and estates lawyer in Ann Arbor , Michigan , says some of her clients want it to be clear that if they 're in a coma , their family should pull the plug .
Others specify they want to be kept alive if they 're in a coma , at least for a few weeks .
' They 've heard stories about how someone wakes up from a coma , even when the doctor said they never would, ' she says .
Either option is legitimate , but without documentation , your wishes can become lost in confusion causing pain and trauma for friends and loved ones .

If you have specific health care wishes you want your proxy to follow , you can spell them out in a living will .
Legal requirements for living wills vary from state to state .

Step 4 : Do n't forget the HIPAA release form

This is the often forgotten form , Deveney says .
Even though it 's your own spouse or parent , or sibling who 's sick , some hospitals wo n't release any medical information because of HIPAA privacy regulations .
It can also be difficult to deal with insurance companies or doctors ' offices on someone else 's behalf without a HIPAA release form , she says .

Lawyers often draw these up for their clients .
Deveney says this form is pretty good , downloadable for $ 9.99 .

Step 5 : Give these forms to several people , and tell your family whom you 've appointed to make decisions for you

' It 's good to broadcast these documents around so somebody will have one when you need it, ' says Carl Schneider , a law professor and bioethicist at the University of Michigan .
' Give them to several family members .
If you have a lawyer , give them to your lawyer .
If you have a doctor , give them to your doctor. '

Also , let your family members know who has your medical power of attorney .
For example , if you 've designated one of your three children to be your health care proxy , tell all three who your choice is .
' That way , if the non-designated sibling happens to be around during an emergency , they can call up the designated sibling and say , 'it 's time for you to kick into high gear .

Letting everyone know also helps avoid hurt feelings later for the unselected .
' You can say , 'I love you all , but I thought Sally would do the best here, ' ' says Schneider .
