Evolve your plans to mark Darwin's 200th - CNN.com
( Travel + Leisure ) -- British naturalist Charles Darwin shocked Victorian society when he suggested that humans evolved from animals over millions of years , and his theories still spark controversy .

February 12 marks the scientist 's 200th birthday and 2009 is the 150th year since he published the pivotal 'On the Origin of Species .
' Expedition organizers and museums across the country are seizing the opportunity to look at Darwin 's evolutionary discoveries .
Here are some fun options :

Take a cruise

The Galapagos , of course , was where Darwin conducted key biological studies during his pivotal voyage on the HMS Beagle .
Today , Darwin enthusiasts can retrace the scientist 's steps , seeing the islands ' black-sand beaches and blue-footed boobies on a cruise organized by the Charles Darwin Foundation in connection with Luxury Adventures ( May 14-24 ) .

Randal Keynes , Darwin 's great-great-grandson , will be a part of that trip ; he 'll also be on an Abercrombie &amp ; Kent excursion to Ecuador and the Galapagos ( call for dates ) .

Or go for a 10-day Galapagos cruise with International Expeditions ( departures through December 28 ) , which steers clear of large birthday events to create an immersive , intimate expedition .
With stops at the Charles Darwin Research Station and a chance to see the famed finches on Fernandina Island , the 32 guests aboard the aptly named Evolution can snorkel with sea lions and sea turtles , explore lava tubes , or just enjoy the ride .

Visit a museum

Museums are jumping on the birthday bandwagon , too .
The Yale Center for British Art in New Haven , Connecticut offers its 'Endless Forms ' exhibit ( February 12-May 3 ) that explores the impact of Darwin 's work on the visual arts .

The Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh hosts a lecture series through April 18 on everything from cosmic time to everyday medical applications of Darwin 's theory .

On the West coast , the celebration continues at the Renzo Piano-designed California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco .
As part of a citywide festival , Evolve 2009 , the LEED-certified science museum will host a kickoff party on February 12 to start a season full of lectures and events through March .

Go back to school

Where better to learn about a brilliant thinker than at a university ?
Harvard 's Museum of Natural History , in Cambridge , Massachusetts is hosting both lectures and family-friendly events ( February 12-March 5 ) , where kids can meet a Darwin re-enactor .

And the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology , in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania presents 'Surviving : The Body of Evidence ' ( through May 3 , 2009 ) , a new exhibit that speaks to the impact of evolution on our daily lives .

Keep evolving

Every year , Michael Zimmerman heads up February 's Evolution Weekend ( this year , February 13-15 ) , which celebrates Darwin 's birthday at nearly 1,000 religious institutions across the U.S. People gather to discuss and reconcile Darwin 's theory with personal faith .

Sound a little esoteric ?
Zimmerman , a professor at Butler University in Indianapolis , believes that even the youngest children should learn about Darwin and evolution .
' All young children are scientists by nature, ' he says .
' They all regularly conduct experiments about the world. '

So bring the family on a trip , to a museum , or to a lecture to ensure you pass on more than just good genes .
