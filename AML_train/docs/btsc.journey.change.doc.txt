Behind the Scenes: Inner city kids travel to South Africa - CNN.com
Editor 's note : In our Behind the Scenes series , CNN correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events .
CNN 's Soledad O'Brien has followed 30 youngsters , ages 11 to 16 , since August , since she traveled with them from Bushwick , Brooklyn , to Johannesburg , South Africa on a volunteer mission to serve the impoverished and AIDS orphans .

NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- The young man looks nervous standing in front of the gym at the Salvation Army Center on Bushwick Avenue .
His eyes are cast down and he shifts from foot to foot , seeming intensely interested in his shoes .

Every 30 seconds or so , he lifts his head .
His eyes dart around the room , taking in about 100 of his friends who are sitting in plastic chairs .
They are dressed in colorful basketball league T-shirts and they chat with each other as they wait to hear Jonathan Severe , 14 , and five of his friends talk about their life-changing journey to South Africa in August .

Severe is a star basketball player and the Salvation Army Center is his home gym .
He usually rules this place and is utterly unused to feeling so terrified here .
The presentation starts with an introduction from the adults in charge and too soon it his turn to speak .

We hear him take a deep breath and he reads from the Power Point presentation projected on the screen .

' The flight to Johannesburg was 18 hours, ' he says .

His delivery is rushed , the words mumbled and odds are good nobody in the audience would have heard him if he were n't holding a microphone .
However , for Jonathan Severe this is a huge success .
He is giving a presentation !

' I was like a proud mommy .
I felt like I had birthed that child, ' Malaak Compton-Rock tells CNN .

Compton-Rock , the wife of comedian Chris Rock , is a tireless advocate and fundraiser for impoverished children .
She stood next to Jonathan during the presentation and was prepared to read a few of his slides if he got too scared .
But he never needed or wanted her help .

This is all especially amazing because when Compton-Rock first met Jonathan last May , he was interviewing to be a part of her 'Journey for Change ' trip to South Africa .
Back then he said maybe six words during the interview .
He barely raised his eyes from the floor despite kicks from his grandmother under the table .
We never thought Compton-Rock would take him .
She did .

On the last day of July she and her staff , along with a group of college-age mentors , took 30 kids ages 11 to 16 from Bushwick , Brooklyn , to Johannesburg , South Africa .
They traveled 8,000 miles on a volunteer mission to serve the poorest of the poor : some of South Africa 's 1.4 million AIDS orphans .

Unfamiliar with Bushwick ?
For years it was a community with a thriving drug trade , severely underachieving schools , extreme poverty and a staggering rate of teenage pregnancy .
It was ravaged by fires and looting during the summer of 1977 and hit hard by the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s .

Bushwick is recovering now , but half of the children under age 18 still live below the poverty line .
A quarter of the adults never make it past the ninth grade and more than half never graduate from high school .

The children Compton-Rock picked for 'Journey for Change ' are what educators and social workers call 'at-risk ' -- at risk of having babies as teenagers ; at risk of never finishing high school or achieving their dreams ; at risk of never knowing the world beyond their neighborhood .

The South Africa trip was Compton-Rock 's brainchild -- to broaden the horizons of young teens and give them perspective on their own lives .

' I believe by traveling you open up your life, ' Compton-Rock told a crowd gathered for a news conference in Johannesburg shortly after the group arrived .
' You do n't think locally , you start to think globally and internationally and I think it gives you a sense of confidence. '

She also wanted the children to know 'that in the United States of America , even in Bushwick , we have certain services that I want the children to understand that they need to take advantage of. '

Compton-Rock is talking about access to free public education , food , knowledge and social mobility -- elusive things for South Africa 's impoverished and particularly so for the country 's AIDS orphans .
This is a lesson all 30 of the Bushwick kids witnessed on their trip .

Jeremy Baker , 15 , was one of the young men on the journey .
He was a leader in South Africa , constantly raising his hand to ask questions and the first to help deliver supplies or try an odd delicacy -- such as fried worms .
However , Jeremy dreams basketball will lead to his success .
He 's not engaged in school and his poor grades do n't reflect his obvious intelligence .

In August , Jeremy found himself sitting in the home of three orphans ages 21 , 17 , and 15 .
The 21-year-old was in charge ; she had been raising her younger sister and brother since she was 16 .
A local charity put her though high school .

' I wanted to be a social worker, ' she told about 15 young people in her living room .
Right now that is impossible .
There is no money for college .
Her sister and brother are finishing high school , thanks to the same charity , but they too fear they 'll never be able to go to college .

Jonathan Severe was with Latoya Massie , 14 , and three other Brooklyn kids when they turned into a dirt alley in Soweto and ducked under barbed wire to meet with a woman who had literally scrawled her dreams on a wall .
Her name is Lindiwe .
The 21-year-old had used bold red to paint a poem on tin .
It begins , 'Each day I dream but it never end .
Each day I plan but it never happen. '

Lindiwe was living in a series of tin shacks with her three children ages 4 , 1 and 3 months , along with an aunt , a grandmother and an 18-year-old brother .
The floor of the home was mud , the roof had holes , there was no refrigerator for food and no light to study by .
Their toilet was at the end of an alley .

The brother said he would like to finish school but there was n't enough money for supplies .

Compton-Rock told the kids to add stationery and pencils to their shopping lists .

' We 'll find out how much your school uniform is and we 'll give that to your granny, ' Malaak promised the young man .
' The kids will do all the shopping for you , and we 'll come back and bring you what you said you needed. '

'OK, ' he said .

Latoya is intimately familiar with American-style poverty : food stamps , pantry food and government checks .
At the end of the alley she told us she was 'speechless .
' That sort of total deprivation was unfathomable to her .

Later that night , the children learned there is not enough money to buy everything on their lists , and Latoya broke down .

' What are you crying for, ' we asked Latoya as she sat atop a picnic table , bawling .

' About all the things they do n't have or that you ca n't do anything about it, ' Latoya replied .
' Ca n't really do anything about it. '

But they could do a little something about it .
The next day , all 30 kids and their mentors went shopping .
They bought loads of rice , canned food , tea , diapers , blankets clothing , shoes and many household items .
They delivered the goods to about 12 different homes in Soweto .
They would also help several more families in a massive slum called Diepsloot .

At the end of the two-week trip in August , Latoya clearly was moved and affected by the experience .
When we asked her what she would take back to Brooklyn , she said with a broad grin , 'Service is the rent you pay for living ! '

It 's a quote from child rights activist Marian Wright Edelman , and one she had heard Compton-Rock use repeatedly throughout the trip .

Jonathan and Jeremy were taking lessons home , too .

' If you 're kinda poor in New York, ' Jonathan explained , 'you 're not kinda poor .
You still have a pair of sneakers and you still go to school. '

On a bright Sunday morning in Johannesburg , Jeremy told us the trip had encouraged him to talk with people and not keep to himself .

' It changed me because I ca n't complain about what I got .
If you give people over here a used shirt or something like that they be real happy and stuff, ' Jeremy said .

Now , the kids have been back in New York for more than six months .
They all signed contracts promising to stay involved with Compton-Rock 's program by volunteering and sharing their experiences with friends .

In September they held a car wash to raise money for a little girl who lost her mother in a shack fire .
They attended a high-end photo auction to raise money for a program that feeds the homeless .
Latoya was one of the 'Journey for Change ' kids who exhibited her work .

' I feel like a celebrity, ' she gushes .
' Come on !
Look at me .
Look at me. '

They are all changing -- some radically , others less radically .
Some of them have taken the lessons on education to heart and their grades have improved dramatically .
Others , who we thought would begin to excel in school , are still failing .
Yet , every child has evolved in some way .

Jonathan , for instance , seems to have a lot more self-confidence .

You can see some of the changes in the blogs they 've posted on CNN.com .
They 've been blogging since August .
There are even more changes you will see on camera when 'Black in America 2 ' airs in July .
