Sources: Police look into sexual assault claim against Copperfield - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- Authorities are investigating a Seattle woman 's allegation that she was sexually assaulted by illusionist David Copperfield , two law enforcement sources told CNN on Friday .

An attorney for the magician 'categorically denied ' the accusation .

But the probe led FBI agents Wednesday to raid a warehouse Copperfield owns in Las Vegas and to search the Las Vegas hotel where he frequently performs .

Attorney David Chesnoff said Seattle police have not given him the name of the woman making the accusation , but he told CNN that the name 'would n't matter really ... because it 's categorically denied as a false accusation , an impossible kind of claim. '

' Mr .
Copperfield 's reputation precedes him as an impeccable gentleman, ' Chesnoff said .

' So we 're obviously disturbed that those kind of allegations are being made , but we believe that that 's a common event now , unfortunately , for celebrated people to be to be falsely accused, ' he said .

' Certainly no one he 's ever had a relationship with could ever say that about him, ' he said .

Earlier Friday , Seattle police said the FBI raid on the warehouse stemmed from an accusation in a police report filed by a Seattle woman over the summer concerning an incident that allegedly took place in the Bahamas .

They did not specify the type of allegation made against Copperfield .

Glenn Miller , chief superintendent in charge of the detective unit of the Royal Bahamas Police force , told CNN he had no official reports of any incident involving Copperfield .

Agents were investigating a case based in Seattle when they entered the warehouse Wednesday night , an FBI spokesman said .

No other information could be made public about the probe , FBI Special Agent Robbie Burroughs said .

A dozen FBI agents stormed the warehouse and took a computer hard drive and a memory chip from a digital camera system , as well as $ 2 million in cash that was inside a safe , reported CNN affiliate KLAS in Las Vegas , citing a source close to the investigation .

CNN could not immediately confirm these details .

FBI agents also searched the Hollywood Theater at the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas , where Copperfield performs , said Yvette Monet , a spokeswoman for the hotel 's parent company , MGM Mirage .

' We are fully cooperating with the investigation as best we can, ' she said .

Copperfield earned $ 57 million in 2005 and the same amount the year before , according to Forbes magazine .

The 51-year-old performs in Las Vegas and around the world , has starred in TV specials , and was named a 'living legend ' by the Library of Congress .

He was once engaged to model Claudia Schiffer .

According to his Web site , Copperfield began performing professionally at age 12 'and became the youngest person ever to be admitted to the Society of American Magicians .
By 16 , he was teaching a course in magic at New York University. '
