Chavez asks for Russia's protection from U.S. - CNN.com
MOSCOW ( AP ) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has called for a strategic alliance with Russia to protect the South American country from the United States .

Chavez is expected to reach a number of agreements for purchasing military hardware while in Moscow , according to news media reports .
One newspaper reported that the deals could be worth up to $ 2 billion .

' That way we can guarantee Venezuela 's sovereignty , which is now threatened by the United States, ' Chavez was quoted by Russian news agencies as saying Tuesday .

Chavez was scheduled for his first meeting with Dmitry Medvedev since he became Russia 's president in May .
He will also meet with Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and Russian military and business leaders , Chavez spokesman Tomas Ramirez said .

Russia 's daily Kommersant reported Tuesday that Chavez is looking to order up to $ 2 billion worth of Ilyushin jets , diesel-powered submarines , TOR-M1 air defense systems and possibly tanks .

Rosoboronexport , Russia 's state-owned arms trader , declined to comment on potential deals .

' We want peace , but we are forced to strengthen our defense, ' Chavez said when asked about the potential deals .

Venezuela , which spent $ 4 billion on international arms purchases between 2005 and 2007 , mostly from Russia and China , has a defense budget of $ 2.6 billion , according to the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies .

The U.S. stopped supplying arms to Venezuela in 2006 .

Chavez also wants to discuss the possibility of creating a joint bank and investment vehicle with Russia , the ITAR-Tass agency reported .

The two sides are also expected to discuss energy deals , Venezuela 's state agency reported , including expanding activities of Russia 's Lukoil with Venezuela 's state-run oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA .

Lukoil is already helping Venezuela quantify heavy crude oil deposits in its Orinoco River basin -- one of the world 's largest petroleum deposits .
Russia 's Gazprom has two natural gas exploration and production licenses in Venezuela .

Commercial trade between Venezuela and Russia reached $ 1.1 billion last year , up more than 200 percent from the $ 517 million in trade during 2006 , according to statistics cited by Venezuela 's state-run news agency .
