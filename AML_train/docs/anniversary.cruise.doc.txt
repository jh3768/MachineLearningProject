Uh-oh, my anniversary cruise is sunk - CNN.com
( Tribune Media Services ) -- Steve Azadian 's 25th anniversary cruise is already booked using his Marriott award points .
But now the hotel wo n't let him take his vacation because it is n't renewing its agreement with Carnival .
Can it do that ?
The rules say , 'yes, ' but Azadian thinks Marriott is wrong .
Who 's right ?

Q : Last year I earned enough Marriott loyalty points to score a cruise with Carnival for my 25th anniversary .
I followed all of the rules carefully .
We booked a cabin and a certificate was issued for the cruise .

But four months before the departure , I learned that Marriott has not and will not sign a new contract with Carnival , effectively canceling my vacation .

Marriott is standing behind legal boilerplate language and wo n't give me the name of a supervisor I can appeal to .
Can you help ?

A : If your cabin has already been booked and paid for with your award points , you should be able to take your cruise .

But the terms and conditions for Marriott 's award program suggest otherwise .
According to the fine print , Marriott and its travel partners have the right to 'change , limit , modify or cancel Program Rules , regulations , rewards , and reward levels at any time , with or without notice , even though such changes may affect the value of points or miles already accumulated , the ability to use accumulated points or miles , or the ability to obtain certain rewards. '

This kind of broad language effectively lets a company withdraw any offer whenever it wants to , leaving loyal customers -- forgive me -- high and dry .
At least that 's how Marriott interpreted it in a series of email exchanges with you , which you were kind enough to show me .

I see this a little differently .
I think it 's perfectly fair to withdraw an offer like a Carnival cruise up to the day you 've booked the cabin .
After that , the deal 's done , and there 's no going back .

Why is it so important that Marriott and Carnival live up to their promises ?
Because chances are , you 've already made additional plans , like hotel reservations , car rental arrangements and airline tickets .
It is n't fair to ask you to cancel those , incurring a significant penalty .

Marriott and its partner companies may interpret their own rules differently .
But I think their rules are wrong .

You should n't have accepted Marriott 's decision to disallow your appeal to a supervisor .
Finding the name of a Marriott executive who is in charge of its loyalty program is n't difficult .
The naming convention for e-mail addresses at the hotel chain is firstname.lastname @ marriott.com , and these folks are known to answer an e-mail from a loyal customer .

After I asked Marriott to take another look at your case , it reversed its decision and will allow you to take your anniversary cruise after all .
