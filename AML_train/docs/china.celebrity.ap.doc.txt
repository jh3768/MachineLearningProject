From Mao to Yao: China's new cult - CNN.com
BEIJING , China ( AP ) -- It will be THE game of Day 1 of men 's basketball at the Beijing Olympics : China vs. the United States , the 21st century 's emerging superpower challenging the 20th century 's titan .

The new 18,000-seat arena is already sold out .
Many will be watching for just one of the hoopsters expected on court that August 10 night : Yao Ming , the 7-foot-6 chiseled giant from Shanghai who has made it big in America 's NBA .

China 's superstar .

Just three decades ago -- a heartbeat historically but a lifetime in a country changing as fast as China -- the Communist Party allowed just one person to tower above the rest : Mao Zedong .
As the toiling masses were made to recite , he was China 's Great Helmsman , its Great Leader ( 'May he live forever !
' ) , the 'Reddest Sun in our Hearts .
' Propaganda posters showed Mao with a Jesus-like aura .

Had Yao played then , he never would have been allowed to get so famous , nor go play for the Houston Rockets and become an NBA All-Star .
But today , China 's people , not the party , are choosing whom they worship as icons .
And worship they do .

In place of the cult of personality that the party built around Mao , the Chinese are embracing a new cult : that of fame and celebrity .
Mao 's portrait still gazes out across Beijing 's vast Tiananmen Square .
But the revolutionary who changed the course of history is being supplanted in Chinese hearts by a firmament of music , sports and movie celebrities .

That journey from Mao to Yao speaks volumes about how China is becoming a freer place for its 1.3 billion people .
To be sure , most Chinese are still reluctant to criticize their government in public for fear of arrest or police attention .
But individuality , once frowned upon by the communists , is now seen as a right by young Chinese .
Members of the Mao generation -- unisex haircuts in proletarian blue and green overalls -- were forced to bow to the supposed collective good .
The cry from generation Yao is 'Look at me ! '

This freedom and the rise of the celebrity are outgrowths of the gradual opening of the economy and society since 1979 .
China was poor 30 years ago .
Now , advertisers seek out celebrities for an edge in a fast-growing consumer market .

Yao takes in millions of dollars annually , endorsing everything from burgers to laptops , credit cards to sodas .
Forbes magazine 's Chinese edition this year again ranked Yao as the top-earning star in China , estimating that he rakes in the equivalent of $ 56 million .

Kung-fu action star Jet Li was second , with estimated annual earnings worth $ 35 million .
Such riches -- which would have been a crime in Mao 's time -- only enhance stars ' popularity and buy them influence , making it harder for government officials to boss them around .
A giant poster of Olympic champion hurdler Liu Xiang hangs on a new clothing store in downtown Beijing , vying in size with Mao 's on Tiananmen Square .

' Now it is no problem that your poster is bigger than Mao .
As long as you do n't put it in Tiananmen Square , nobody cares, ' said Yue Xiaodong , who studies Chinese youth and idol worship as a professor at Hong Kong 's City University .
' This is why the communists are getting hugely popular among young people , because they give young people hope that you can become famous , glamorous , wealthy overnight , and you can be individualistic , be yourself. '

Few are better placed to measure the thirst for fame in China than 'Allen ' Su Xing .

Life for the willowy , doe-eyed 24-year-old turned upside down when he reached the final of 'Superboy ' -- an 'American Idol ' knockoff that took China by storm last summer .
Fans gave him 2.5 million votes , phoned in at 15 cents a pop , exercising a democratic right the Communist Party still does n't extend to the way China chooses its political leaders .

Su 's second place finish ( winner Chen Chusheng got 3.3 million votes ) was enough , he hopes , to launch a music career .
The former student now wears dark glasses and hats to avoid being recognized in public .
Flying back from out-of-town concerts , he finds fans waiting for him at Beijing 's airport , bearing gifts .
He has three boxes in his apartment filled with thousands of fan letters , some perfumed and covered with hearts .
And this before he has recorded his first album , due next year .

' There are so many people who are trying so hard to be famous, ' Su said in an interview , fiddling with a bracelet of black and silver beads given to him by a fan .
' We do n't want to be part of a crowd .
We want others to see us as individuals. '

While communist officials can no longer dictate which stars make fans giddy , they do come down hard on those whom they deem to have stepped out of line .

Wang Zhizhi seemed destined for stardom when he became the first Chinese-born player in the NBA in 2001 .
But his refusal to report back for national team duties infuriated Chinese officials .
Wang was kicked off the Chinese squad .

' When the motherland needed him , he did not care about what 's good for the country, ' China 's Basketball Association said .

Only after a public apology in 2006 -- 'Please give me a chance to start again, ' state media quoted him as saying -- was he welcomed back .
Now , with he and Yao both recovering from injuries , they could play together at the August 8-24 Beijing Games .

Comely actress Tang Wei suffered official ire this year , apparently because she appeared in explicit sex scenes in Ang Lee 's award-winning spy thriller 'Lust , Caution .
' Chinese media reported in March that regulators ordered TV stations in Beijing and Shanghai to stop reporting on Tang and pull advertisements featuring the actress .
The government 's broadcasting watchdog was quoted as saying that 'undressing to get famous ' set a bad example for youth .

' You have to consider these things .
That is the reality here ... There are a lot of people watching you, ' Su , the 'Superboy ' singer , said .

' Especially the political side, ' he added .
' If you really say something that you should n't say , I do n't think you 're gon na have a healthy career .
If they say , 'OK we do n't want you to be on TV, ' then you can not be on TV. '

In his 12th-floor office in a forest of new office towers in Beijing , Wang Jipeng stokes the celebrity cult as CEO and founder of iFensi.com , a Web site that is a one-stop shop for celebrity news and gossip .
Launched in 2006 , the site draws 2 million hits a day , 'and it 's growing every day, ' said Wang .

He oozes energy .
By 2 p.m. , he 's still not found time to eat .
His lunch box of vegetables and rice sits untouched next to a half-filled ashtray on his cluttered desk .
The 35-year-old , who previously taught media studies at Bohai University in China 's northeast , talks with a missionary 's zeal about his venture .

' People believe in stars like they believe in God .
I bring all of these little gods , these adored stars , together into one place .
So you could say that iFensi.com is a Web site that sells belief, ' he said .

It 's a winning formula .
The site got nearly 1 million responses in 2006 when it offered to buy Valentine 's Day roses for fans ' favorite celebrities for 30 cents each .
One fan sent 2,000 rose requests , and some celebrities got more than 10,000 roses .

Celebrity fan clubs are sprouting up around the country .
Xiao Feng , a planning director in a public relations firm , runs one for the 'Superboy ' runner-up .
Callers to her mobile phone hear a few bars from one of Su 's songs before she picks up .
In her thirties -- she would n't give her age -- Xiao got giggly when talking about him in an interview .

' With the big stars , you can only look on from afar .
But with this kid , we walked with him each step of the way , from ordinary Joe to singer and perhaps , in the future , to star, ' Xiao said .
' We see him as a friend , as a younger brother. '
