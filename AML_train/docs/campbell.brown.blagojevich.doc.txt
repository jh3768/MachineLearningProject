( CNN ) -- Let 's establish one thing at the outset .
Of course , the governor of Illinois is innocent until proven guilty .

That is a bedrock principle of American law and applies in this case as surely as in any other .

All the things we 've been talking about are allegations .

The whole point of a criminal trial is to settle beyond a reasonable doubt whether the things that have been alleged are in fact true .
So , yes , the governor of Illinois is innocent .

But it is preposterous , outrageous really , given the charges against him , that Democratic Gov .
Rod Blagojevich is still in a position to name Barack Obama 's successor as junior senator from Illinois .

I mean , when police officers are facing serious charges , they are routinely suspended from active duty pending resolution of the charges against them .

They are innocent until proven guilty , sure .
But common sense dictates that no dangerous chances be taken while the jury is out .
Should n't that be the case here , too ?

How can it happen that a man accused of trying to sell a seat in the United States Senate still has the right , if not to sell that seat , to legally give it away ?

Imagine having Rod Blagojevich come out today to announce that you are Illinois ' next senator ?
Talk about the kiss of death .
At this point , I 'll bet he could make out like a bandit soliciting handsome fees not to name people senator .

Back , though , to the important thing , the presumption of innocence .

It is sacrosanct , but the system should incorporate some mechanism , something , to keep a figure facing extraordinary charges from doing harm while those charges are being investigated .

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Campbell Brown .
