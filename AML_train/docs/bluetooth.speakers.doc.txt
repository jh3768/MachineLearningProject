Cell phone speakers complement music handsets - CNN.com
( CNET ) -- One of the best things about reviewing gadgets is the chance to play with something you 've never played with before .

This time we 're not talking about a particularly groundbreaking technology , but even so it 's still pretty cool .

Though we 've reviewed quite a few cell phone speakers , all of the models that we 've examined have used a wired connection to the phone .

So , we now turn our attention to the Nokia Bluetooth Speakers MD-7W .
Simple in form and function , the MD-7W speakers are portable , easy to use , and offer decent audio quality to boost .

At $ 179 they wo n't come cheap , but we could n't help but like them .

As cell phone speakers go , the MD-7W speakers are on the larger side .

Each speaker measures 4.13 inches by 2.6 inches by 2.04 inches and weighs 5.6 ounces .
That means they wo n't slip into your pocket , but you should n't have any problem carrying them in a bag or purse .

Thanks to magnets in each speaker , you can clasp them together in a single cube for even easier portability .
Also , Nokia includes a carrying pouch for added protection .

Setup is beyond easy .
The connecting cable is 15.7 inches , so you 're given a fair amount of room to separate each speaker .
Yet , we noticed that the speakers were the slightest bit wobbly .
You can tip them backward with a gentle push so we recommend that you place them on an even surface .

The only controls are on the right side of the right speaker .
There 's a volume rocker , a power/pairing button , and a control that activates the 3D stereo-widening sound feature .

All of the buttons are large and tactile .
Below them are a charger port and a 3.5mm audio jack for the included line-in cable .
You can use the cable with a non-Bluetooth phone or a Bluetooth phone that does n't have a stereo A2DP profile .

To pair the speakers with a phone , you 'll need to hold down the power button until the light behind the right speaker grille blinks rapidly .

We took just a few seconds to connect our Nokia 5300 Xpress Music , and we were ready to go .
The light will continue to blink slowly when music when music is playing ; it will flash red when you 're turning the power off .

When listening to music , you can adjust the volume both on the phone and on the speakers .
The stereo-widening feature did n't make a noticeable difference , but it 's a nice feature just the same .
When using the line-in cable as an antenna , you also can use the speakers to listen to your phone 's FM radio .

When testing with our 5300 Xpress Music , sound quality was quite satisfying overall .
The audio was a bit bass-deficient , as is common on speakers of this sort , but our tracks were remarkably sharp and clear .

What 's more , the audio has a lot of warmth and was without any tinny effects .
Besides the 5300 , the Nokia Bluetooth Speakers MD-7W are compatible with other Nokia phones or most other handsets with a stereo Bluetooth profile .

As mentioned earlier , you can use other phones with the speakers , but then you 're not really getting your money 's worth .

The MD-7W speakers run on four AA batteries ( two in each speaker ) .
If you 're near an electrical outlet and want to save battery life , you also can power them with the included wall charger .

Just be aware that the charger will not power rechargeable batteries that are in the speakers .
That would be a nice , though not necessary , feature to have .
