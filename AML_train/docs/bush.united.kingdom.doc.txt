Messages conflict over tighter Iran sanctions - CNN.com
LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- The European Union has agreed to freeze the overseas assets of Iran 's Bank Melli , British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said Monday , but a spokeswoman for the EU 's foreign policy chief said no decision had been reached .

A spokesman for the British Foreign Office said there are 'technical steps to be put into place, ' and 'the action is likely to come into effect in the next few days .
' He could not explain the discrepancy coming from the E.U .

Brown said at a news conference Monday with U.S. President Bush that the sanctions were in the works .

' We will take action today that will freeze the overseas assets of the biggest bank in Iran , the bank Melli, ' Brown said .

Brown said new measures against Iran would be continued if the Islamic regime failed to address concerns over its nuclear ambitions .

' Action will start today in new phase of sanctions on oil and gas .
We will take any necessary action so that Iran is aware of the choice it needs to make, ' Brown said .

But a spokeswoman for European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana told CNN the 27-member bloc had not imposed restrictions on the Iranian bank .

' Today there was no decision on Bank Melli, ' Cristina Gallach said in an e-mail .
' I can not say to you when a decision on deepening further sanctions can be taken. '

The British Foreign Office was not able to explain the discrepancy .

Solana visited Iran on Saturday and briefed EU foreign ministers Monday about his trip .
He urged Iran on Saturday to guarantee the 'peaceful nature ' of its nuclear program to get cooperation and support from the EU .

Iran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes .
But it has refused to meet U.N. Security Council demands to halt its nuclear fuel program , and the International Atomic Energy Agency reported in May that Tehran had not provided critical information that would support its position .

The United States imposed sanctions on Bank Melli and two other top Iranian financial institutions -- Bank Mellat , and Bank Saderat -- in October 2007 .

Bush said Monday he has not ruled out the use of force to end Iran 's suspected nuclear weapons program , but added that he preferred to resolve the dispute diplomatically .

At the morning news conference Brown also announced additional troops for Afghanistan .

Britain will increase its presence in Afghanistan from 7,800 troops to 8,030 by next spring , UK Defense Secretary Des Browne later told British lawmakers .

In his announcement to the House of Commons , Browne admitted the 230 additional troops 'does not in proportionate terms represent a very significant increase. '

' It does mean our mission is expanding, ' Browne said .
' It means we are taking the steps necessary to take our mission forward as effectively as we can. '

The additional forces will join Britain 's existing troop presence in the southern Afghanistan province of Helmand , where allied forces are battling a resurgent Taliban .

The prime minister also ruled out any early withdrawal of British troops from Iraq -- a move that would upset the United States -- insisting forces would not be 'traded ' between Iraq and Afghanistan .

Bush , in Britain for the last leg of what is seen as his farewell tour of Europe before leaving the White House next year , praised Brown 's commitment to Iraq , describing him as a 'good partner. '

Before their meeting , U.S. officials were forced to deny a rift between Brown and Bush over troops withdrawals from Iraq after a newspaper reported that the U.S. president was expected to urge the prime minister not to set a timetable .

Asked if he 'got it wrong ' on Iraq , Bush said : 'History will judge the tactics.... Removing Saddam Hussein was not wrong .
It was the right thing to do ... for 25 million Iraqis. '

Bush and Brown said they talked about Zimbabwe .
Brown condemned what he said was a 'criminal cabal ' that 'threatens to make a mockery of free and fair elections .

He called on Zimbabwean officials to accept international observers to monitor the June 27 presidential runoff election pitting long-time President Robert Mugabe against opposition candidate Morgan Tsvangirai .

Bush ended the European tour in Northern Ireland where he met First Minister Peter Robinson and his deputy Martin McGuinness .

Before arriving in Britain , Bush met Saturday with French president Nicolas Sarkozy , where talks also focused on Iran .

During his tour , which has called in at Slovenia , Germany , Italy and France , Bush has urged Europeans to stand firm with the United States as it seeks to transform the Middle East .
