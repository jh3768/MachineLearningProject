SHREVEPORT , Louisiana ( AP ) -- Actors Josh Brolin and Jeffrey Wright and five others involved in filming the Oliver Stone movie 'W ' were arrested during a bar fight Saturday morning , police said .

Shreveport police Sgt .
Willie Lewis said the seven were arrested just after 2 a.m. at the Stray Cat bar .

The Times of Shreveport reported that Brolin was booked and posted $ 334 cash bond to be released .
Police did not say Saturday night whether he or the others had been released .
The paper said they are part of the crew filming 'W, ' about President George W. Bush .

A call to Brolin 's publicist was not immediately returned Saturday night .

' W ' began filming in May in Shreveport .
Brolin plays President Bush and Wright plays former Secretary of State Colin Powell .

The cast also includes Elizabeth Banks as first lady Laura Bush , Ellen Burstyn and James Cromwell as the elder Bushes and Thandie Newton as Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice .

Brolin appeared in three films last year .
They were 'In the Valley of Elah, ' 'American Gangster ' and 'No Country for Old Men, ' which won the best-picture Oscar .

Wright won a Tony Award for 'Angels in America ' on Broadway and a Golden Globe for the same role in the television miniseries .
He also has appeared in 'Syriana, ' 'Ali ' and 'Casino Royale. '

' W ' is Stone 's third presidential film , following 'Nixon ' and 'JFK .
' He also directed the Vietnam sagas 'Born on the Fourth of July ' and 'Platoon, ' which won four Oscars including best picture and director .

The Academy Award-winning director only began shopping his script for financing in January , but has quickly captured the interest of investors and Hollywood .

Stone has said the film , which will focus on the life and presidency of Bush , wo n't be an anti-Bush polemic , but , as he told Daily Variety , 'a fair , true portrait of the man .
How did Bush go from being an alcoholic bum to the most powerful figure in the world ? '
