How to be sodium savvy - CNN.com
' Enough salt already, ' sighed Theo Hodge on a recent evening as I added more salt to a plat de resistance I was preparing for us .
Considering that he was my doctor , the scolding came as no surprise .
But as a chef and food writer , I know sodium chloride salt is an important ingredient in many recipes .
Both professional and home cooks equate salt with flavor .

However , the more we use , the more our palates desire .
Hodge 's insistence was a matter of health , so I would have to come up with other ways to enhance future dishes .

The year before , my failure to heed his warning about soaring cholesterol levels landed me in the ER with a heart attack .
Once the doctors cleared the arterial problem , it was up to me to keep it that way , but I was so busy cutting saturated fat from my diet that I did not pay attention to sodium intake , which was also important to my heart health .
I made a common error , figuring that since my blood pressure was routinely normal , I could continue to salt my food without worry .

' Sodium has benefits , like helping to maintain the body 's right balance of fluids, ' says my cardiologist Richard Katz , MD , director of the cardiology division of George Washington University .
' But ingesting too much salt is a prime cause of increased blood pressure .
Higher blood pressure is a major cause of heart attacks and strokes , both of which can be reduced by minimizing salt intake .
' Even among healthy adults there is usually room for improvement in the blood pressure department .
' If blood pressure is 125/70 , it 's better at 120/70, ' Katz says .
( The American Heart Association [ AHA ] notes that low blood pressure is relative for each person and is a concern when it drops suddenly .
Your doctor can help you reach a blood pressure goal that best enhances your health .

Various organizations , including the USDA , AHA , and Cooking Light magazine , recommend less than 2,300 milligrams sodium daily ( the amount in one teaspoon of table salt ) for healthy people .
Most Americans consume closer to 4,000 milligrams a day .

' Only a quarter of sodium intake actually comes from salting our food, ' says AHA President Dan Jones , MD .
' More than 75 percent of sodium in our diets comes from processed foods .
' Salt is a natural preservative and it enhances flavor , so it 's no surprise that salt and other forms of sodium are included in packaged foods .

Because salt is so pervasive in our food supply , 'One has to be sodium-conscious at every step : at purchase , at preparation , and at consumption, ' says Jones .
The most effective overall strategy to control sodium intake is to cook food at home as often as possible using fresh fruits and vegetables , grains , low-fat dairy products , fresh meat , poultry , and fish .

The first step to keep sodium under control is to make smart choices at the grocery store .
Choose sodium-free , low-sodium , or no-salt-added convenience foods .
Sometimes organic versions of packaged foods are lower in sodium than regular and reduced-sodium versions , but not always .
Check the label .
Reading the Nutrition Facts Panel is an easy way to gauge the amount of sodium present in a food .
If an item contains more than 20 percent Daily Value ( DV ) of a nutrient , a serving of that food is considered to contain a high amount of that nutrient , according to the FDA ; five percent DV of a nutrient is deemed low .
For sodium , 20 percent DV equals 460 milligrams ; five percent DV sodium is just 115 milligrams .

Lower-fat or fat-free products can be higher in sodium than their full-fat counterparts : An ounce of full-fat sharp cheddar cheese has less sodium than one ounce of fat-free cheddar .
When fat , a major vehicle for flavor , is removed , other ingredients like sodium may be added to compensate .
Still , if you 're trying to limit saturated fat in your diet by enjoying low- and fat-free foods , the trade-off may be worth it if you limit sodium in other areas .

Ingredients processed with sodium still have a place in the cupboard , provided you use them judiciously .
Low-sodium soy sauce , tamari , and fish sauce add meaty , round notes in addition to a salty flavor .
Canned tomato products can stand in for fresh in soup or chili when good fresh ones are n't in season .
A range of cheeses and bacon also offer a salty boost along with their own distinct flavors in egg and cheese breakfast tacos with homemade salsa or the cheddar-bacon drop biscuits .

Cook sensibly

You also can control sodium when cooking .
Rinse and drain canned foods to wash away some of the salty components in the packing juices , even if you ca n't eliminate additives the food may have already absorbed .
For example , rinsing and draining capers or olives would barely make a dent in the sodium content because they are preserved with a salty brine solution and absorb the sodium .
But for an item like canned beans , draining the juices cuts some sodium , while rinsing and draining shaves even more .

When cooking starches or grains , do n't salt the cooking water , so the noodles or rice do n't absorb additional sodium dissolved in the liquid .

Marinating is a smart way to infuse meats and fish with flavor .
Mixing your own marinades takes just a few minutes and allows you to control sodium .
Traditionally a marinade is an acidic liquid -- citrus juice or vinegar , for instance -- that boosts flavor after an ingredient soaks in the mixture .
And since marinades rely on acid , spices , herbs , and aromatics for flavor , a sprinkle of salt before or after cooking intensifies the mixture 's qualities .
Even when marinades include higher-sodium components , like fish sauce or soy sauce , ingredients absorb minimal amounts of the marinade .
In a pinch , choose low sodium bottled marinades .
( In general , you should skip the salty preseasoned or marinated options offered at many meat and fish counters .

Mouthwatering marinades that boost flavor without adding a lot of fat .

During my career as a professional chef , I often used ingredients along with salt to impart flavor ; now I 've learned to balance flavors with less of the mineral .
Salty is one of the senses of taste , and salt -- whether kosher , sea , or table variety -- supplies that sense of taste to foods that lack it .
Instead of adding salt at every step in a recipe , I now often use salt at the very end , such as sprinkling steamed vegetables with a pinch of a crunchy finishing salt like fleur de sel , which puts the salt granules on the surface of food , heightening that sense of flavor .
Any salt added at the end of cooking will also bolster the food 's aromas ( another important factor for sensing tastes ) .
For a final flourish , I find that aromatic grated lemon or lime rind brings clean , citrusy flavor while the fruit 's juice adds a pleasing acidity that brightens other seasonings in soups , kebabs , or relishes and chutneys .
I rely on a rainbow of peppercorns -- zesty white ones to pair with potatoes ; green ones to add a fresh , clean note to beef tenderloin ; and black to proffer pungency to almost everything -- fresh and dried herbs , and spices for sodium-free flavor .

Eat well

As it turns out , the less salt you consume , the less your palate craves , according to a study published in 2007 in the Journal of the American Dietetic Association .
After two weeks on a control diet with 3,500 milligrams of sodium a day , 354 participants were assigned to either continue the control diet or follow the DASH diet ( a diet emphasizing low saturated fats , plenty of fruits and vegetables , whole grains , and low-fat dairy products ) .

Over the next three months , the diets ' sodium contents were adjusted every 30 days : low ( on par with average sodium intakes in non-Western countries ) , intermediate ( the current recommendation for 2,300 milligrams of sodium a day ) , and high sodium ( just under the average American 's daily sodium consumption ) .
At the end of the study , researchers discovered that participants had high levels of compliance at each of the three sodium levels , but volunteers rated the intermediate sodium level to be most acceptable .
' I 'm convinced that salt taste is learned and conditioned, ' says study author and researcher Frank Sacks , MD , Professor of Cardiovascular Disease Prevention at the Harvard School of Public Health .

I 've found that to be the case .
Cutting back on sodium has n't been as hard as I thought it would be .
I 've incorporated lower-sodium convenience options into my cooking .
I 've shifted to using high-quality , salty ingredients as accents or garnishes instead of a main ingredient in sauces or pizza toppings .
Then simple techniques , like infusing broth with Parmigiano-Reggiano rind to enrich the flavor of a soup , or serving dishes piping hot ( when appropriate , because heat heightens the palate 's sense of taste ) , are easy to do .
And I 'm also encouraged to know that as time goes on , my palate will adjust to a lower-sodium diet , and my heart will be happier and healthier for it .

Ubiquitous mineral

Sodium partners with other compounds ( besides the well-known sodium chloride ) as a food additive .
Cake mixes , flavored milks , luncheon meats , jarred condiments , and snack foods may include ingredients that add sodium .
The mineral may also seem hidden since many of these foods may not taste salty .
Here are just a few of the many forms sodium can take :

& # 8226 ; Disodium guanylate ( flavor enhancer )

& # 8226 ; Disodium inosinate ( flavor enhancer )

& # 8226 ; Sodium alginate ( thickener )

& # 8226 ; Sodium benzoate ( preservative )

& # 8226 ; Sodium bicarbonate ( texture enhancer )

& # 8226 ; Sodium citrate ( pH influencer )

& # 8226 ; Sodium hydroxide ( pH influencer )

Bean counters

Here 's a look at the sodium content of various canned black beans on the market , and how label reading , and rinsing and draining , contribute to sodium savings .
Always check labels as different brands may vary slightly .

& # 8226 ; 1 ( 15.5-ounce ) can black beans , drained = 859 milligrams

& # 8226 ; 1 ( 15.5-ounce ) can black beans , rinsed and drained = 815 milligrams

& # 8226 ; 1 ( 15.5-ounce ) can 50 % -less-salt black beans , rinsed and drained = 780 milligrams

& # 8226 ; 1 ( 15-ounce ) can organic black beans , rinsed and drained = 420 milligrams

& # 8226 ; 1 ( 15-ounce ) can unsalted black beans , rinsed and drained = 90 milligrams
