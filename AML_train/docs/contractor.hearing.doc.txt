Senator: Waste, fraud, neglect hurting U.S. soldiers - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- Tens of billions in taxpayer dollars have been lost , wasted or remain unaccounted for in Afghanistan and Iraq , and some of those funds -- and some missing weapons -- have landed in insurgents ' hands , a U.S. senator alleged Wednesday .

Sen. Robert Byrd , D-West Virginia , leveled the accusations before the Appropriations Committee he chairs .
He is calling for arrests and speedy trials for any contractors accused of bilking the U.S. and Iraqi governments .

In a statement released before Wednesday 's hearing , Byrd said the military 's inability to oversee its myriad contracts adequately has indirectly killed soldiers .

He did not elaborate except to say , 'As a result of this lack of oversight , billions of dollars have been lost or wasted , bad contractors have been rewarded , and shoddy workmanship -- some of which has resulted in the deaths of our soldiers -- has gone uncorrected. '

Critics have 'rightfully ' blamed the Bush administration for the misconduct , Byrd said , but culpability extends beyond the executive branch .

' Army commanders , as well as those in the other services , also deserve serious criticism for failing to grasp the strategic situation in Iraq and for not properly planning to implement the massive logistical requirements associated with sustained combat and post-combat operations, ' Byrd said in his opening statement .

Too few auditors and managers have been assigned to oversee contracts , and too few investigators are charged with prosecuting allegations of fraud , waste and corruption and with retrieving 'these stolen billions, ' Byrd said .

' It is evident that our oversight resources have been strained past the breaking point, ' he said .
' Army contracting dollars and actions have increased more than 350 percent over the last 11 years , while the contracting work force has decreased by more than 50 percent. '

Gen. Benjamin Griffin , head of the U.S. Army Materiel Command , told the committee that the military is aware of the shortcomings in its audits .
The Army Contracting Command has recently filled leadership posts and is seeking to create more in hopes of addressing the problems .

Contractors are vital in an all-volunteer military force , and most contractors operate honestly because they want to continue doing business with the U.S. , added Deputy Defense Secretary Gordon England .

When there is evidence that contractors have 'willfully done something wrong, ' they are prosecuted , England said , but information indicating intentional wrongdoing is sometimes hard to obtain .

' I will say sometimes it 's harder in a war zone, ' England said .

Byrd said the neglect has emboldened those who have designs on embezzlement , bribery , providing shoddy goods and services or 'just plain stealing. '

The senator from West Virginia said he would like to see more 'collars and dollars ' -- more arrests , indictments and recovery of lost or wasted funds .

Sen. Patrick Leahy , D-Vermont , said he and Sen. Chuck Grassley , R-Iowa , have introduced a bill to extend the statute of limitations for crimes involving waste , fraud or abuse of taxpayer dollars .

Leahy asked England and the Defense Department 's acting inspector general , Gordon Heddell if , given their present limitations , such legislation would provide the additional time needed to pursue such cases .
England and Hedell said it would .
