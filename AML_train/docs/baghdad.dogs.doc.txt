Stray dogs being killed in Baghdad - CNN.com
BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) -- The shotgun blast rips into the stray dog 's midsection , sending it tumbling over and over .
Agonizing yelps echo through the streets as it tries to reach and bite at the gaping wound .
Minutes later , the dog is dead .

A few miles away , a puppy eats a piece of poisoned meat .
Its body starts to twitch and spasm as the toxins kick in .
It dies within 15 minutes .

The two strays were among the thousands that roam the streets of Baghdad .
Authorities have been killing them since November , trying to prevent the spread of disease and attacks on residents .

The Baghdad dog-culling program comprises two vets , a council official and a police officer armed with a shotgun .
The vets distribute bits of meat poisoned with strychnine .
If the poison does n't kill the dogs , the police officer steps in with the shotgun .

' I do have mercy for all animals, ' veterinarian Khalil Abdullah said .
' But we ca n't vaccinate the wild animals in the street , and we do n't have the means or ability to bring them all to the hospital. '

The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals ( SPCA ) International calls the methods used by the Baghdad culling program inhumane .
SPCA spokeswoman Terri Crisp says the organization understands that Iraq is a war zone , posing a unique set of challenges , but alternatives such as mobile spay and neuter and vaccination programs are available .

' We 've seen this work in other countries that have very similar stray animal problems, ' Crisp said .

Just killing the strays dogs is a bandage approach , she said .

The SPCA has offered to help the Iraqi government , but the response has been slow .

' Given all of what 's going on over in Iraq right now , it takes time .
Things do n't always move as quickly as we would like them to, ' Crisp said .
But , she said , other programs , including one that allows U.S. military personnel in Iraq to bring their pets back to the States , have taken time to take root .

The Iraqi government welcomed offers of help but said the strays are the responsibility of Baghdad 's municipal government .

Municipal officials said they have no other options other than killing the dogs .

' We do wish that our situation here in Baghdad would improve in general , so that we can then provide better solutions for issues like the stray dogs , so we can have the same standards as European countries, ' local council head Shakib Mohammed said .
' But we do n't even have tranquilizer guns .
What you see is the best we have. '

The last dog culling in Baghdad took place before the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 .
Since then , the stray dog population increased dramatically and became a threat to humans , authorities said .

Some Iraqis say that in areas where the sectarian killing was high and bodies lined the streets , the dogs became used to eating human flesh .

An Iraqi veterinarian said that makes the strays more aggressive toward humans .

Students at a girls ' high school in Baghdad welcomed the culling teams , saying the dogs had become a menace .

' They would attack us in the morning when we were on our way to school, ' student Hanan Sami said .
' Not just one but packs of them. '

The girl said she has a pet dog and loves animals , but said the strays have to be dealt with .

Headmistress Mahassen Youniss said critics of the culling program should consider human rights before animal rights .

' How are we supposed to deal with dog bites and the spread of disease when we have such a lack of medicine here ?
' Youniss said .

As the search for strays goes on , a puppy yaps from behind a pile of rubble .
Adult dogs scatter .
Abdullah takes pity on the puppy .
He 'll take it home and vaccinate it , he says .

The others in the street are going to have to fend for themselves .
