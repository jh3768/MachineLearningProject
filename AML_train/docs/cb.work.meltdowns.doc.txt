How to avoid a major meltdown at work - CNN.com
At some point , all of us have had a bad day at work .
Even if you like your job , chances are you have experienced a day where something or someone at work was wearing you down .

You may also have been overwhelmed or preoccupied by things that happen at home or outside of work .

Sometimes , those commonplace stressful moments keep building until a meltdown happens -- a massive , off-the-tracks-train-wreck meltdown .
And it can happen to even the most professional employee .

Debra Gordon , now a self-employed medical writer in Virginia , was working for a major metropolitan newspaper as a reporter when her meltdown occurred .
Gordon 's editor was pressuring her to stay for a meeting , but she had made a commitment to attend her son 's school play .

A verbal conflict with the editor ensued , escalating until Gordon reached her snapping point , screamed 'I quit !
' and drove away in tears .
Gordon ended up returning to work after another employee mediated , but the environment remained unfavorable , and she resigned a few months later .

Having a meltdown at work can be embarrassing , but witnessing it can be even scarier .
Jamie * , a political strategist in Florida , recalls one such incident , when the procedure for handling absentee ballots was changed near Election Day .

Jamie watched his colleague panic , which turned into a full-fledged meltdown .
' He was yelling , screaming and literally throwing ballots against the wall saying , 'These are n't worth the paper they 're printed on !
My career is over !
' ' Jamie recalls .
He pulled his colleague aside and told him to take a deep breath and count to 10 , while other volunteers picked up the ballots .

Even happy workplaces can spark meltdowns .
Dennis Snow is a former employee of an well-known amusement park who has written a book about his 20 years as a staff member .
Snow witnessed several meltdowns over the years .
One of the most memorable occurred at a very popular attraction .

As he explains , when a ride is closed , a staff member will stand at the entrance of the ride to personally deliver the bad news to the eager patrons .
One ride was closed for restoration , and Dennis , who was assuming his shift at the entrance to the ride , found his co-worker in full meltdown mode .

' She was not only in tears , she was inconsolable .
Guests were n't even going near her because of her sobbing, ' he says .

' I asked what was wrong and she said , 'I just ca n't take it anymore !
If one more person blames me for this stupid ride being closed , I 'm going to just quit .
One father pointed at me and said to his kids , 'Thank the lady for ruining our vacation !

Any of this sound familiar ?
If you , a co-worker or a manager are nearing a breakdown , this may be a sign that things at work are out of balance .
You and your officemates should consider these preventative measures :

Encourage communication at work

Discussing workplace stress and blowing off a little steam is important .
Nobody wants to create a negative atmosphere with nonstop ranting about work , but talking about your frustrations or challenges is healthy .

If those frustrations are impacting your ability to get your job done or are impacting a number of people on your team , be sure to escalate that discussion to include your supervisor or upper management .

Assess your workload

Meltdowns are also more likely to happen if a larger portion of the workload is resting on one set of shoulders .
If the balance or work in your department is off-kilter , talk to your supervisor or manager .

They may not be aware of the issue .
Even if you are incredibly busy , take the time to cross-train other employees whenever you can .
The investment of time pays off handsomely when those co-workers are able to take on a bigger workload .

Take a break

With layoffs and reduced staffing levels , many workers have been pushed to the brink simply because they feel overwhelmed .
It may be tempting to forego taking a break or a lunch when you have a backlog of work .
Make sure you get away from your desk at least a few times a day .

If you can , go outside and walk around the block or around the building .
If the weather is not cooperating , try finding a quiet place indoors , like an unoccupied conference room .
If all else fails , close your eyes and take 10 long , deep breaths at your desk .

Offer a helping hand

Your co-worker or manager may have personal issues that are wreaking havoc at work .
Though you clearly want to respect everyone 's privacy , ask your co-worker if everything is OK. If he or she discloses a problem , encourage them to find solutions .
Many employers offer an assistance program to employees with resources that will help with issues like child care , elder care and drug and alcohol dependency .

It is important to address any issue that triggers a meltdown before it happens .
Your co-workers , managers and companies may be compassionate when you experience stress , especially if you are apologetic about it afterwards , but there is a risk of crossing the line .

A meltdown could result in probation , suspension and ultimately termination .
If the issue is important enough to trigger a meltdown , it should be a priority to address the issue and resolve it .
