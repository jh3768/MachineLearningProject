Troubleshooter: Remember my rate, Alamo - CNN.com
( Tribune Media Services ) -- When Steve Chan 's car rental company in Ireland runs out of the vehicle he reserved , it offers to set him up with a car from another company .
He 's led to believe that he 'll pay the same rate , but when his credit card bill arrives , Chan discovers he 's been billed more than twice the price he was first quoted .
Now Alamo , the company he first rented from , wo n't refund the difference .
Does Chan have a case ?

Q : I would like your help in resolving a problem with a car rental .
My wife and I rented an Opel Astra from Alamo on a recent visit to Ireland .
When we arrived at the car rental counter , an agent told us the car we reserved was not available , but that she could get Budget to rent us a comparable car at the same rate .

When we received our credit card bill , we discovered that Budget had charged us $ 572 -- more than 2-1/2 times the originally quoted rate of $ 222 .

I admit that I signed the rental agreement with Budget , which in hindsight was a mistake .
However , the Alamo representative led me to believe that Budget was charging me the Alamo quoted price .
Had I known that we were paying more than twice what we were first quoted , I would have never agreed to the Budget rental .

I feel that Alamo owes us the difference between the first and second rate .
I 've been trying to resolve this with Alamo 's customer service department , with no luck .
Can you help ?

A : Alamo did the right thing by offering to arrange a rental from another company when it ran out of Astras .
But it should have covered all of your expenses , not just some of them .

This looks like it could have been a simple misunderstanding .
Maybe Alamo gave the wrong rate information to Budget .
Maybe Budget made an error in calculating your rate .
It 's also possible that there was some currency confusion at work -- substituting dollars for euros or euros for British pounds .

Car rental companies -- actually , any travel company -- will usually try to charge you the highest possible rate .
( After all , they 're not running charities .
) That 's why it 's so important to always be on guard , checking and double-checking every rate quote and bill before signing it .

Here 's what should have happened .
When you checked in at the Alamo counter , you should have had a printout of your confirmed rate in hand .
Alamo should have offered you two options .
The company could have either upgraded you to the next class of car at no additional cost , or it could have paid for your entire rental through another company .

Assuming you still picked the second option , you needed to go to the Budget counter with the Alamo agent and verify that you were still getting the price you had agreed to .
I know you realize now that simply signing the contract without reviewing it was a mistake , and I do n't want to make you feel any worse about it , but for future reference -- always read before you sign !

Your signature makes it difficult to negotiate a refund from Alamo and all but impossible to pursue a credit card dispute or to take the company to court .
Still , your situation was n't hopeless .
If you reserved your car online , you might have argued that Alamo was breaking its best rate guarantee .
Or , if you booked through a travel agent , you could have asked your travel adviser to help secure a refund .

I contacted Alamo on your behalf , and it issued a refund for the difference between the first and second rate .
