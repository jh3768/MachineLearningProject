Godfather / Godfather Part II Francis Ford Coppola , 1972 ; 1974 Coppola 's masterpieces are not only the greatest film and sequel of the genre , but perhaps two of the best films ever made .
Boasting casts featuring huge stars ( Brando , Pacino , De Niro ) they focus on the Corleone family , a mafia dynasty in New York from the 1920s to the late '50s .
Slickly made , beautifully shot and featuring some of the finest screen performances on record .

Goodfellas Martin Scorsese , 1990 'As far back as I can remember I 've always wanted to be a gangster .
' Focusing on the dirty end of the mafia , this film charts the rise and fall of Henry Hill , a man of Sicilian-Irish descent who works his way up the tree of organized crime in New York during the '60s and '70s .
Powerful and violent , this is one of Scorsese 's finest moments .
Joe Pesci earnt an Oscar playing an unpredictable and terrifying gangster : just do n't call him funny .

Mou gaan dou ( Infernal Affairs ) Wai Keung Lau &amp ; Siu Fai Mak , 2002 The basis for this year 's Best Picture Oscar 'The Departed, ' this is a tense and exciting thriller which hints at the strength and depth of Asian gangster movies .
Steeped in nervy and fast-paced tracking shots around the underworld of Hong Kong , and embellished with two extraordinary performances from the two lead actors , Scorsese did n't need to change much to make it an Oscar-worthy picture .

White Heat Raoul Walsh , 1949 'Made it Ma !
Top of the world !
' A true classic of the genre , starring one of the best known and loved gangster actors , James Cagney .
A dangerously deranged criminal , who is obsessed with his mother and gives little thought to killing anyone who crosses him , breaks out of prison to avenge his mother 's death and secure control of his gang -- but he unwittingly takes a rat into the organization .
The blueprint for modern crime thrillers .

Once Upon a Time in America Sergio Leone , 1984 An epic feast of sumptuous sets , beautiful tracking shots and outstanding performances , especially from Robert DeNiro and James Woods .
A gang of children progress from small scale crimes to become embroiled in the mafia during prohibition in the U.S. with shocking and violent results .
The framework that holds the story together is a dream-like wander through New York of 1968 , where DeNiro relives his past .
A beautiful and sedate shell to an elaborate and fascinating gangster movie .

Scarface Brian De Palma , 1983 The archetypal and truly iconic sleazy '80s gangster movie , this is the American dream gone bad .
Tony Montana , played by Al Pacino , arrives in Florida as a refugee from Communist Cuba , and sets out to make his fortune as a cocaine dealer , but becomes consumed with possessive greed .
The movie has two of the most striking and memorable scenes in film history : one a torture scene with a chainsaw , piling on the tension with the screaming soundtrack ; the other , of course , 'Say hello to my leettle friend ! '

Angels with Dirty Faces Michael Curtiz , 1938 Another influential Cagney movie , and perhaps the first classic of the genre .
The friendship of two boys from Hell 's Kitchen is rekindled as one gets out of prison to find the other is a priest .
Uncovering corruption throughout the city , this is a story of sacrifice and honor that proves gangsters are people too .

Get Carter Mike Hodges , 1971 Michael Caine 's finest hour , as he gets tough with the '70s gangsters of northern England .
Relentlessly brutal , Caine works his way through the seedy underworld , and at every unpleasant turn gives a dry quip , seduces a femme fatale or wreaks bloody violence on the murderers of his brother .
An unstoppable revenge movie .

Sexy Beast Jonathan Glazer , 2000 One of the most extraordinary gangster films of recent times .
Oscar-nominated Ben Kingsley gives one of his most remarkable turns , as a character that 's the polar opposite of his most famous role , Ghandi .
A misanthropic , bitter and aggressive gangster , with a penchant for colorful language , he makes this a truly unforgettable movie .

Cidade de Deus ( City of God ) Fernando Meirelles &amp ; K á tia Lund , 2002 This Brazilian film shockingly paints a gangster world populated by children as brutal and heartless as any character in 'Goodfellas .
' At once a beautiful and traumatic carnival , the movie flits between the gritty realism of life in the favelas of Rio and the dream-like existence of a child attempting to escape a world of crime .

Get Carter Stephen T. Kay , 2000 Remakes of classics should be banned .
A flat and stupid film featuring -- heavens above -- Sylvester Stallone wandering around attempting to play on his image as a meathead with a personality .
Unfortunately , his personality is so weak the film is unwatchable .
Its Hollywood-style ending insults the hard-nosed message of the original , which was uncomfortable for representing the seediness of the 60s underworld ; this time round , we 're cringing because it 's awful .

Analyze That Harold Ramis , 2002 'Analyze This ' was a nice idea ; not a patch on 'The Sopranos, ' which has taken the theme of gangster-in-therapy to exciting and original places , but still a nice idea .
The sequel is embarrassing .
Repeating many of the same jokes , with two very talented actors , Robert DeNiro and Billy Crystal , doing their level best to destroy their highly esteemed careers , this is a sham of a film .
Seeing DeNiro prance around a cell singing 'I Feel Pretty ' will make you cry .

Mickey Blue Eyes Kelly Makin , 1999 This Rom-Com/gangster movie combo was destined for failure .
It features a tired performance from Hugh Grant as another foppish apologetic Brit who downright loves a pretty girl ; she just happens to be the daughter of Sonny from the Godfather .
Hilarity ensues .
It 's weak , and awkward .
James Caan and Hugh Grant ?
A bad idea , badly executed .

Dick Tracy Warren Beatty , 1990 What a waste !
A cast that would make any director weep , a huge budget , Warren Beatty directing after his critically acclaimed 'Reds ' and one of the biggest cult comic books as a basis .
What happened ?
Let down by some very odd production choices and the casting of Madonna ( truly bad ) , this may have been the inspiration for modern adaptations like 'Sin City, ' but it took a tough and exciting comic and made it cartoonish and ridiculous .

Be Cool F. Gary Gray , 2005 A hollow and blatant attempt to make money .
Mixing some of the greatest actors in the business today with a list of celebrities who ca n't really act at all , it took everything that was good about 'Get Shorty ' and threw it away .
At every turn where the original had been clever and cool , the sequel is silly and irritating .
A waste of money , a waste of the likes of Harvey Keitel , James Woods and Danny DeVito , and a waste of time .

Now it 's your turn .
