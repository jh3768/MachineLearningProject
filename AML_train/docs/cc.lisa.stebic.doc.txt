Mother of two in troubled marriage vanishes - CNN.com
NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- There is little doubt of the trouble existing in Lisa and Craig Stebic 's marriage , say friends , family and court documents .

Craig Stebic admits to filing for divorce just four months before his wife 's disappearance .

They 'd been in the midst of a tumultuous separation , while still living under the same roof .
They had hardly spoken to one another in the last months before she vanished .

On the very day Lisa Stebic went missing -- April 30 , 2007 -- she had petitioned the court to have her husband evicted from the family home , her family said .

It has now been a year and a half since the mother of two disappeared .

According to her husband , she left at 6 p.m. , taking her cell phone and purse , while he was working in the backyard .
Lisa Stebic often went jogging at the local track field around that time , but no one saw her that evening at the track .

Police say there has been no activity on her cell phone or credit cards .

For weeks afterward , police and search teams combed nearby areas , hoping to find the missing 37-year-old from Plainfield , Illinois .

The FBI joined in and divers searched bodies of water located near the Stebic home , but they have found nothing .

Police searched the Stebic home with a warrant in mid-May 2007 .
During the search , Craig Stebic was cooperative , allowing them access to the family computer and two vehicles , police said .

Police have not released the results of this search or investigation .
But despite his cooperation with police , Stebic still refuses to take a voluntary polygraph and will not permit his children to be interviewed by police about their mother .
While he has not been named a suspect in the disappearance of his wife , police say he is officially a person of interest .

Police did announce that they believe foul play was a likely factor in Stebic 's disappearance , though they have not said what evidence leads them to that conclusion .
They say that Craig Stebic 's refusal to let anyone question his children has been impeding their investigation .

Lisa Stebic 's parents and friends insist she would never go off on her own , leaving behind her children , who were 10 and 11 at the time .
Even Craig Stebic says that he does n't believe she would stay away this long voluntarily , especially from her children .

Craig Stebic and Lisa Stebic 's family have been locked in a battle over visitation rights with the children in the last year , but finally last month a settlement agreement was reached .
This gives hope to police and family that they might finally be able to question the children about the day their mother disappeared .

Craig Stebic maintains his innocence in the disappearance of his wife .
His attorney , Dion Davi , says , 'I do n't understand why the police have named my client a person of interest .
He has told police everything he knows about the day his wife disappeared. '

Craig Stebic filed for sole custody of the children not long after his wife vanished .
This request was denied by the court .
Also , a few days after he was named a person of interest in his wife 's disappearance , Stebic filed a motion to have their divorce proceedings dismissed .
Stebic said his reason was that high legal bills adding up while they waited for news about his wife made a divorce proceeding impossible at the time .

Lisa Stebic 's family and the Plainfield , Illinois , Police Department ask anyone having information on the whereabouts of Lisa Stebic to please call their tip line at 815-267-7217 .
They are offering a $ 75,000 reward .
Stebic is described as being 5 feet 2 inches tall and 120 pounds with brown hair and brown eyes .
