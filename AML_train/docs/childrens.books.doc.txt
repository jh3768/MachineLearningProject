Kids are the experts in reviewing children's books - CNN.com
ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) -- What William Goldman once said about Hollywood -- 'Nobody knows anything ' -- can easily describe the decisions made by children 's book publishers .

Dr. Seuss ' 'And to Think I Saw It on Mulberry Street ' reportedly was rejected by 28 publishers before it was finally released .

Maurice Sendak 's 'Where the Wild Things Are ' inspired debate over its appropriateness for children and was also turned down by several publishers .

That beloved series has now made her Britain 's wealthiest woman .

So CNN.com turned to three staffers ' children , each a different age , to review books appropriate for their cohorts .
