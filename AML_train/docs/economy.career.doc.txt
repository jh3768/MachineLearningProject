Bad economy? Do what you love - CNN.com

( CNN ) -- Two roads diverged before Jennifer Jackson in this flailing economy : She could restart her career as an electrical engineer or pursue her childhood dream of becoming a hairdresser .

Jackson , 39 , took the road less traveled , opening a hair salon in Chicago , Illinois , last fall .

' Jobs are n't out there like they used to be, ' says Jackson , who has 12 years of engineering experience at corporate giants like Motorola and AT&amp ; T .

Still , the college-educated professional recently struggled to find an engineering position in the dismal job market .
' I decided to get creative and completely shift gears. '

The economy looks bleak with unemployment climbing to 7.6 percent last month from 7.2 percent , according to the U.S. Department of Labor .
Meanwhile , foreclosures mount while benefits , savings and pensions deteriorate .

As job security from corporate America fades , Jackson and others see the economic downturn as an unexpected chance to transform hobbies or youthful fantasies , once-dubbed impractical , into grown-up careers .

' I 've spent most of my professional life making money for other people 's companies, ' says Laura Waldusky , who opened her own jewelry shop this month in Houston , Texas , after being unable to find a job in 2008 .
' Why not invest my talents in , well , myself ?

Waldusky , who worked for major labels like Louis Vuitton in the past , tried to find a design job for months when the stock market plunged last fall , but says job opportunities were scarce .
She had been designing her own jewelry as a hobby for many years and decided to use her savings to make her jewelry business a full-time gig .

Professionals are realizing the prescribed path of a college degree leading to a lucrative job may no longer exist , as the volatile economy takes a toll on some of the soundest professions , such as banking and law .
Almost every day Fortune 500 companies announce more layoffs , leaving remaining workers left to fear they may be next .

Some small businesses owners say launching a new venture in tough times is better than doing nothing .

' It may not be as glamorous or as prestigious as what you had been doing before you lost your job , but it may well save you, ' says Walter Kerschbaum , a 63-year-old antique clock collector , who opened a shop called Scarsdale Antique Clocks in Hartsdale , New York , two years ago .

When a Wall Street financial firm let Kerschbaum go two years ago , finding new work was hard because his age made him less attractive to firms , he says .

He decided to make his talent for fixing clocks and his penchant for collecting them into a career .

At his cozy store surrounded by the melody of ticking clocks , Kerschbaum happily works seven days a week for an income that is meager but enough for him and his wife to live on .

There is no doubt small businesses have been hit hard by the financial crunch .
Prospective entrepreneurs have plenty of reason to feel risk averse .
Even in a good economy , the most successful businesses need a lot of capital , especially with tight credit markets , experts say .

Only 80 percent of businesses survive after the first year and the chances dwindle to 44 percent after four years , according to the Small Business Administration .

' It 's not the ideal time , but that does n't mean you ca n't do it, ' says Hallie Crawford , a certified career coach based in Atlanta , Georgia .
' I think because of the way the economy is that you just have to be a little bit more careful. '

Some famous businesses were born in an economic slump .
Proctor &amp ; Gamble Co. began selling household products in Cincinnati , Ohio , during the Panic of 1837 .
FedEx Corp. started a shipping business out of Memphis International Airport in Tennessee during the oil crisis of 1973 .

The number of small businesses is increasing in the United States .
According to the federal Small Business Administration , the number of nonemployer firms has risen steadily this decade to 21.1 million in 2007 , a jump from 16.5 million in 2000 .

Jim Penson , 55 , of Arlington , Texas , went solo after working in the information technology field for mid-size to large companies for decades .
The jobs had once provided a comfortable salary for his family , he says .

But by 2004 , Penson was feeling the pinch from the dot-com bubble burst .
He had been laid off several times .
He diligently sent out over 800 job resumes but only found rejection .

' I was Joe-middle-class-go-to-work-in-a-cubicle-for-20-years, ' he says .
' When all that was stripped away , what was left was my music. '

That 's when Penson , an avid Bluegrass musician , decided to form PensonStringWerks.com , a company that offers banjo and mandolin lessons .
Today , he teaches more than 20 students .
Going solo is a rockier road with a pay cut , but he says he is getting by doing what he loves .

In a bad economy , savvy entrepreneurs can capitalize on low overhead costs , cheaper commercial leases and advertising rates .
They can also pick from a larger , more qualified pool of laid-off workers , says David Seaman , an author who writes about personal branding .

' It 's very scary , but you have to put in big to win big, ' says Erica Bethe Levin , who started an online city guide for women called CheekyChicago.com last fall after being laid off from a public relations company last year .

Jeffrey Cornwall , director of the Center for Entrepreneurship at Belmont University in Tennessee , says small business owners must be fiscally conservative and adapt to changing customer demands .
Launching a business during an economic crisis can be a good time to steal market share from established yet vulnerable competitors .

One perk to being small : Since small businesses employ less people , enabling the organization to hunker down and reduce expenditures when the economy goes sour , he says .

Back in Chicago , Jackson 's salon , Asili Chi Salon &amp ; Spa , operates full time .
Between clients waiting to get their hair trimmed and styled , Jackson says she 's happy with the path she chose .

' If I could n't go out there and do something different , then I was n't living to my full potential, ' she says .
