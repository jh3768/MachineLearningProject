Yemen arrests al Qaeda member once held at Gitmo - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- Yemen authorities have arrested and extradited a Saudi man who rejoined al Qaeda after he was released from the U.S. military 's detention facility at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .

Yemen 's embassy in the United States announced the arrest of Mohammad al-Awfi on Tuesday .
Its state-run news agency reported Wednesday that al-Awfi has been extradited to Saudi Arabia .

Saudi Arabia recently asked for Interpol 's help in apprehending al-Awfi and 84 other wanted al Qaeda suspects .
It was a rare admission by the kingdom that some of its most wanted terrorists are on the loose , and it needs help in finding them .

Al-Awfi goes by several names , including Mazin Salih Musaid Awfi , Abu Hareth Awfi , and Muhammad Ateeq Uwaidh al-Aufi .

Last month , he appeared in a video along with another Guantanamo detainee , Saeed Shihri , who is believed to have been responsible for an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Yemen that killed nearly a dozen people last September .

The attack came barely a year after both men were released from Guantanamo to the custody of Saudi Arabia .
Shihri is one of al Qaeda 's top leaders in Yemen , and al-Awfi is the group 's field commander .

Interpol issued a rare global security alert for the men last week .
Interpol Secretary General Ronald Noble said it was the first time the international police organization has 'been asked to alert the world about so many dangerous fugitives at one time. '

President Obama last month ordered the Guantanamo detention facility closed within a year .
Where the almost 250 detainees now in Guantanamo will be moved to has not been determined .
