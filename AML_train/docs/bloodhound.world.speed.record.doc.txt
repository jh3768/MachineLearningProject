Bloodhound rocket car sniffs out 1,000-mph land speed record - CNN.com
LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- Speed enthusiasts hope to build a rocket car that can go faster than a bullet from a handgun -- and break the world land speed record .

If it succeeds the Bloodhound SSC ( super sonic car ) , unveiled at London 's Science Museum Thursday , will travel at more than 1,000 mph -- or Mach 1.4 -- beating the existing low altitude record for aircraft of 994 mph .

The vehicle 's driver will be wing commander Andy Green , a Royal Air Force fighter pilot , who set the current speed record of 763 mph with Thrust SSC in October 1997 .

The three-year mission will be led by Richard Noble , who also project-led the Thrust SSC and himself held the world speed record between 1994 and 1997 .

Noble said : 'The next three years are going to be tough , testing and damned exciting. '

The wheels on the jet- and rocket-powered car , which will be 12.8 meters long and weigh 6.4 tons , will spin at more than 10,000 times per minute .

Green added : 'I 've met graduate engineers who are adamant that our previous record was what inspired their career choice as youngsters : that sort of thing makes all the effort worthwhile .
Bloodhound SSC will be so much faster and , we hope , will fire up every school kid about the science and technology .

The project , which is privately financed through sponsorship , hopes to promote public interest in science and technology as well as develop new technology in engineering .

Paul Drayson , science minister for the UK government , which is funding an accompanying education program , said : 'This project is not just about the bragging rights to the world land speed record .
This will result in tangible scientific developments that will benefit all , for example in areas such as fuel efficiency and safety and which could be used in the cars we drive in the future .

The Bloodhound team are now searching the world 's deserts , hunting for a race track capable of taking the supersonic car , the project said on its Web site .

The location needs to be perfectly flat and without vegetation for 10 miles , as well as reliably dry for at least three months each year and capable of supporting living quarters , technical backup and security .

So far the team has narrowed the hunt down to 14 sites -- eight in the United States , four in Australia , one in Turkey and one in South Africa .
