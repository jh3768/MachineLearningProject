19 dead in Afghan suicide bombings - CNN.com
KABUL , Afghanistan ( CNN ) -- Eight Taliban suicide attackers struck Afghan government buildings and a prison Wednesday killing 19 people in a coordinated attack that the Taliban said was in retaliation for the mistreatment of prisoners , according to Afghan officials .

The deadliest strike happened at the Ministry of Justice where five of the attackers stormed the building here , prompting a three-hour firefight with Afghan soldiers and police , defense ministry spokesman Gen. Mohammed Zahir Azimi said .

' This attack shows the real face of the Taliban, ' said Gen. David D. McKiernan , with the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force .
' This is another example of the Taliban impeding progress for Afghans. '

It was the same type of attack carried out by the Taliban in October , also against Afghan government buildings in Kabul in broad daylight .

The exact breakdown of the 19 deaths and 45 injuries from Wednesday 's strike was not clear , but Azimi said most of the casualties were at the justice ministry , including civilians and guards .

Afghan forces shot a suicide attacker at the Ministry of Education , but he managed to detonate his explosives outside the building , Azimi said .
There were no other casualties .

Two suicide attackers detonated their explosives at a prison near the Khair Khana district , north of Kabul , causing several deaths and injuries , according to Azimi .

The Taliban claimed responsibility , saying they were retaliating against the mistreatment of prisoners in Afghan jails , Zemarai Bashary of the interior ministry said .

In the attack at the justice ministry , two gunmen burst in and killed three government employees before police overpowered them , Bashary said .

Police swarmed in , looking for more assailants .
Witnesses who had gathered outside heard intermittent bursts of gunfire from deep within the building .

Shortly before 1 p.m. Wednesday , police dispatchers said officers found a third gunman holed up in one of the rooms .
He was killed in the gun battle that ensued .

In late October , Taliban suicide bombers stormed the Afghan Ministry of Information and Culture and opened fire on guards outside the building in a coordinated attack that left at least five dead .
Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said the attackers killed six guards in the attack , which targeted 'foreign advisers ' at the ministry .

A French soldier and his interpreter were killed in an attack in Afghanistan Wednesday , according to the office of French President Nicolas Sarkozy .
A second French soldier was seriously wounded .

' This morning the President of the Republic was greatly saddened to learn of a murderous attack... against French soldiers who patrolled with a part of the Afghan national army in Logar province , south of Kabul, ' the Web site statement said .
