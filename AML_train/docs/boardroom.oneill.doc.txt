Rugby rigor: John O'Neill  - CNN.com
SYDNEY , Australia ( CNN ) -- In a country that demands excellence on the sporting field , John O'Neill has achieved the equivalent , off it .

This former senior banker has three times won Australia 's Sports Executive of the Year .
He was the brains behind the brawn of Australia 's world-beating Rugby Union team of the 1990s and the man who helped take the country 's soccer team to the World Cup Finals in 2006 , their first World Cup appearance in more than 30 years .

O'Neill has recently returned to running Australian rugby after five years away , and he 's facing an uphill battle to restore the game .
Finances are at a critical level , attendances are down , and the national team the Wallabies have been struggling .

The Boardroom 's Andrew Stevens met him at Australian Rugby HQ in Sydney and began by asking why he 's prepared to risk his own reputation all over again .

O'Neill : I thought about that and openly said on the day of the announcement of my return , the greatest risk for me was in failing .
People are saying you ca n't reheat old soup and etcetera , etcetera , but I always believe in backing myself .
I 'm not a miracle-worker , I 'm not a messiah .
But I took the decision that standing back and just watching rugby from afar and joining in as one of the many critics is just not in my style , I would much rather participate in the turnaround .

Stevens : From what you see and your experience , is there much difference between being the leader of a sports team , leadership on the field and leadership off the field , leadership in business ?

O'Neill : Not a lot of difference at all .
The fundamental of leadership , I think , transcends sport and business -- You need courage , you need composure , so when a lot of people around you might be losing their heads , someone will stay calm that is the same on the field as it is off the field .

Stevens : And what are the unique aspects of managing the sports industry that apply to just the sport ?

O'Neill : Well it 's uniquely collaborative in a bank , for example , you go through a process to present to the managing directors , chief executives a proposal , and the CEO will make the decision and the organization will enact it .
I learned that very early in rugby that taking the decision is the easy part , getting people to do what they were told was entirely different .

Stevens : You are obviously highly motivated , how do you motivate your people ?

O'Neill : I motivate people by teaching them to enjoy success .
You have to give people a reason to feel happy about coming to work and get a spring back in their step -- that we are in a bit of a downturn here but just sitting around glumly , you know , naval-gazing wo n't get you there , you really have to... Now here are the strategies , here 's what we are going to do , and we are going to do it together .
