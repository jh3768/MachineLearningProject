Ten tall tales told on résumés - CNN.com
R&eacute ; sum&eacute ; s are a critical part of any job search .
They are the most effective marketing tool any of us have about who we are and what we can do .
And all of us want our r&eacute ; sum&eacute ; to be the best possible representation of our work .

But some workers turn their r&eacute ; sum&eacute ; s into a work of fiction instead of a representation of fact .
A CareerBuilder.com survey of hiring managers and workers looked at the tall tales and bold lies used on r&eacute ; sum&eacute ; s .

Here are the 10 most outrageous whoppers , as reported by hiring managers :

Candidate claimed to be a member of the Kennedy family

Applicant invented a school that did not exist

Job seeker submitted a r&eacute ; sum&eacute ; with someone else 's photo inserted into the document

Candidate claimed to be a member of Mensa

Applicant claimed to have worked for the hiring manager before , but never had

Job seeker claimed to be the CEO of a company when he was an hourly employee

Candidate listed military experience dating back to before he was born

Job seeker included samples of work , which were actually those of the interviewer

Applicant claimed to be Hispanic when he was 100 percent Caucasian

Candidate claimed to have been a professional baseball player

Modifying your r&eacute ; sum&eacute ; is a lot like airbrushing a photo , and many of us may have made minor tweaks to our r&eacute ; sum&eacute ; s. You may have revised a job title that sounded uninspiring or omitted a hellish work experience from your list .

But there 's a line between bending the truth and outright deception .
According to the CareerBuilder.com survey , these were the most common falsehoods people admitted to using on a r&eacute ; sum&eacute ; :

& # 8226 ; 38 percent of those surveyed indicated they had embellished their job responsibilities

& # 8226 ; 18 percent admitted to lying about their skill set

& # 8226 ; 12 percent indicated they had been dishonest about their start and end dates of employment

& # 8226 ; 10 percent confessed to lying about an academic degree

& # 8226 ; 7 percent said they had lied about the companies they had worked for

& # 8226 ; 5 percent disclosed that they had been untruthful about their job title

Do these lies work ?
In most cases , no .
Most companies disqualified candidates after discovering their dishonesty .
Thirty-six percent still considered the candidate , but ultimately passed on hiring them .
Six percent of hiring managers overlooked the 'flawed r&eacute ; sum&eacute ; ' and hired the applicant anyway .

The survey also found some industries seemed to be more likely to have incidences of r&eacute ; sum&eacute ; fabrication .
The industry reporting the most deceit was hospitality , with 60 percent of employers reporting they found lies on r&eacute ; sum&eacute ; s. Transportation/utilities field and information technology followed close behind with 59 percent and 57 percent of hiring managers respectively .

The industry with the fewest liars : government at 45 percent .

How do you make a r&eacute ; sum&eacute ; stand out without resorting to dishonesty ?
What can you do to be attention-getting for the right reasons ?
Here are some recommendations .

Be the first in line .
One-in-five employers said they are receiving more r&eacute ; sum&eacute ; s this year than last year .
A good way to break out from the crowd is to be the first one in line .
Sign up for e-mail alerts and perform daily searches for jobs in a specific field or industry .

Use keywords .
Many hiring managers and HR departments are using new technology to review job candidates .
Applicant tracking systems scan r&eacute ; sum&eacute ; s and provide the managers with a ranking based on keywords in the document .

Among the terms employers searched for most often : 'problem-solving and decision making skills, ' 'oral and written communication, ' 'customer service, ' 'retention, ' 'performance ' and 'productivity improvement, ' 'leadership, ' 'technology, ' 'team-building, ' 'project management ' and 'bilingual. '

Stand out .
Many of the hiring managers ( 43 percent ) said that they spend a minute or less looking at r&eacute ; sum&eacute ; s. Think of your r&eacute ; sum&eacute ; as a written audition .
You have a limited window of opportunity to have the attention of the hiring manager , so make the most of it .
Focus on specific accomplishments and tangible , positive results that you achieved at previous jobs .

Be honest .
If you have a gap in employment periods , explain why .
Mention any volunteer work you did or classes you took at these times to show that your skill set is still current and highlight what you have accomplished .
People often forget to include volunteer work , part-time jobs and freelance work in a r&eacute ; sum&eacute ; , even though that work is often relevant to your career path .

If you did not complete a degree , do not claim that you did ; college and university attendance is easy to verify .
List graduation date , the time frame you attended any institutions and major .
