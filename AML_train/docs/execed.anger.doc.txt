When emotion takes over - CNN.com
LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- Imagine this hypothetical situation : You 're a hard-nosed business trader and I 'm a contact who 's just passed on a great tip on some undervalued shares .
Do you take me up on the advice ?
Well , to imagine some more , it depends on whether or not you argued with your spouse that morning .

Really ?
You might think that businesspeople , especially top level executives , keep their emotions , not least those connected to non-workplace matters , completely separate from commercial dealings when in the office .

Not according to an innovative new study by two business school professors which contains potentially vital information for anyone in the money making world , particularly during these tough financial times .

The paper -- 'Blinded by Anger or Feeling the Love : How Emotions Influence Advice Taking ' -- explains how people receiving advice or guidance can be easily influenced by so-called incidental feelings , that is to say emotions not directly connected to the business in question .

' We focus on incidental emotions , emotions triggered by a prior experience that is irrelevant to the current situation, ' the two authors , Maurice Schweitzer of the University of Pennsylvania 's Wharton business school and Francesca Gino , a professor of organization at Carnegie Mellon University , say in the paper .

' We find that people who feel incidental gratitude are more trusting and more receptive to advice than are people in a neutral emotional state , and that people in a neutral state are more trusting and more receptive to advice than are people who feel incidental anger. '

Why does this matter ?
Because advice , in its various forms , is an integral part of everyday business , whether in the form of our hypothetical stock tip or suggestions by a colleague or boss .
According to the study , this tendency to be swayed by outside moods is not just an incidental curiosity but can systematically distort rational decisions .

' If I ask you something complicated like , 'Should we hire this person or should we buy this house ?
' you have to consider a lot of attributes and compare a lot of complex things, ' Schweitzer says .
' So we often use a simple summary statistic , which is how we feel about the job candidate or the house .
When we do that , we open ourselves up to the possibility of making a mistake based on emotion. '

The paper demonstrated the hypothesis through a complicated experiment in which college students were asked to make a judgment about something they could not know for certain -- guessing someone 's weight in a photo -- before having their moods swayed either positively , negatively or neutrally by snippets from films intended to provoke either anger , euphoria or no strong feelings .

After seeing the film clips the students were asked to re-estimate the weight , but this time with some outside advice which was -- although they did n't know it at the time -- largely helpful .

The verdict ?
' The emotion manipulations significantly influenced the accuracy of participants ' final estimates, ' paper says .

Participants 'who experienced incidental gratitude weighed advice more heavily than did participants in a neutral state .

' Participants who experienced incidental anger weighed advice less heavily than did participants in a neutral state .
Even though the emotions induced in this study were unrelated to the judgment task , we find that these emotions significantly changed the extent to which participants relied upon advice. '

In a follow up test , Schweitzer and Gino carried out an identical experiment but also asked the students how much they trusted their 'adviser ' , who was described as a previous participant .
And yes -- the angry group showed the least trust .

Of course , as Schweitzer points out , many businesspeople might already know this unconsciously and adjust their actions accordingly

' If I have emotional intelligence , I know what the right time to talk to my boss is .
I know that my new partners had a terrible flight and lost their luggage and are n't going to be receptive to what I 'm saying , so I should n't make my pitch right now .
Or I know that , if I take them to this particular restaurant or I buy tickets to this Indy car race , I can shift their emotional state to feeling more gratitude toward me and listening to me. '
