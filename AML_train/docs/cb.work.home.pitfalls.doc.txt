Pitfalls of telecommuting - CNN.com
( CareerBuilder.com ) -- When we think about telecommuting , we often focus on the blissful freedoms that come with it .
Freedom to set our own hours , raid the refrigerator ... even take early morning calls in our underwear .

There are other conveniences as well : no more rush hour traffic and more time for family interaction .

Yet as great as all that sounds , telecommuting can have its drawbacks , as well .
Here are some of the challenges telecommuters face as well as suggestions for how to overcome them .

Family 'turf ' problems

When your family or significant other ( s ) are not used to having you around the house , your sudden and constant presence can cause tension and disruption .

Children who are used to having the run of the house can resent having to stay quiet and out of the telecommuter 's work area .
Spouses forget that the telecommuter is actually working and can shift an unreasonable amount of household responsibility upon him or her .

To avoid these types of tensions , set up your workspace in a quiet area away from the central traffic of the house .
Establish work/life boundaries .
And do n't even think about trying to work and watch small children at the same time !

Let the other members of your household know that even though you 're home , you 're on the job and need to block out eight or nine hours to complete your daily work .

Social isolation

Some telecommuters find they miss the social aspects of working with other people .

Irline , a copywriter and new mother , thought working from home would be ideal , because she could be close to her daughter during the day .

However , once Irline began her arrangement , she no longer found her job satisfying ; she missed the collegial atmosphere of her office and said her work suffered .

' As an extrovert , I get energy from those around me, ' Irline reflects .
' I thrive on social interaction... being able to wander down the hall and kick around ideas with my co-workers helps my creativity and keeps me charged. '

While some people can compensate by keeping in contact by phone or e-mail , others need social contact on a frequent basis in order to work productively .
Irline ended up going back to the office and telecommuting just one day a week .

Staying focused

Some find it difficult to work from home because it is full of distractions and diversions but devoid of anyone to manage them and keep them on track .

Neighbors drop by to chat , the school calls for volunteers or a particularly juicy episode of Oprah is airing .
Only the most organized , independent and disciplined of workers will be successful telecommuting .

To stay on course , keep in close contact with your boss and co-workers to ensure you meet their expectations .
Develop a regular routine and set goals and deadlines for completing your work .
Find ways to reward yourself for being productive .

Being visible

Still others are concerned that by not physically being in the office they will be forgotten or overlooked for plum assignments and promotions .

To make sure you do n't become a case of out-of-sight/out-of-mind , make yourself available for meetings , conferences and industry events .

Schedule a lunch date with your boss and co-workers at least once a week and keep your boss apprised of your progress and accomplishments .

And finally , do n't let concerns of telecommuting become a self-fulfilling prophecy .
Remember managing your career is more about performance than presence .
