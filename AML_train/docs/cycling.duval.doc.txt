Saunier Duval quit cycling after drugs bust - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- Saunier Duval have pulled out of cycling , blaming the drug scandal that engulfed the team at the Tour de France .

The company acted after star Italian rider Riccardo Ricco failed a dope test on stage four -- prompting the entire team to pull out of the race last week .

Both Ricco and his compatriot Leonardo Piepoli , who had won the prestigious Bastille Day stage but had not failed a dope test , were sacked last Friday after breaking the team 's 'Code of Ethics' .

A statement issued by Saunier Duval read : 'This decision by the company was taken following the recent case of doping involving one of the team 's cyclists , Riccardo Ricco , and the suspicions against another cyclist. '

However , bike manufacturers Scott , the second sponsor of the team , revealed later on Wednesday that they would step in and rescue the Spanish outfit .

American firm Scott , who has supplied the team 's bikes and had a contract with Saunier Duval until 2010 , said they would provide financial support to the team for the rest of the season only .

' The team will be called Scott , unless a new title sponsor comes in, ' said Pascal Ducrot , a Europe-based Scott company official .
' After that we 're sure the team will find a new title sponsor. '

In a statement released by Saunier Duval , Scott said it was 'convinced that the recent events which damaged the team 's reputation at the Tour de France were caused by individuals' .

' We see this as an opportunity to multiply our efforts to fight against doping .
In the future our own anti-doping program will be far stricter. '

Saunier Duval , part of a German company specialising in domestic heaters and air conditioning units , are the second sponsor to turn their back on cycling at this year 's Tour de France .

The first was Barloworld -- who acted after their rider Moises Duenas tested positive like Ricco for the banned blood booster EPO , also on stage four .
