Tips for backpacking with a baby - CNN.com
YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK , California ( AP ) -- It had been at least 24 hours since we had seen other humans , and the trail seemed to be ours alone -- gleaming granite slabs , scrabbly switchbacks , glorious glimpses of the Grand Canyon of the Tuolumne River , and jagged Sierra spires under cloudless skies .

But the meditative crunch-crunch-crunch of our boots soon gave way to men 's voices .
A trio of bearded 20-somethings approached .

' Whoa , baby !
' gasped the group 's gnarly looking leader , pointing to our son , snuggled up in a baby carrier on my chest .

' Lucky dude !
He gets a free ride !
' joked another .

' Can you carry me , too ?
' wheezed the laggard .

My husband , Stephen , and I stopped to chat with them .
It was our fourth Yosemite trip of the year , and we had become accustomed to questions , comments and astonished stares from nearly everyone we met .
Few people have seen a toddler in the back country -- let alone a woman carrying a loaded backpack , plus her child strapped to the front .

But , judging from the number of people who ask us how to do it , many people are curious .
Here 's a primer on 'Backpacking with Baby, ' or BWB as I call it .

With or without a baby , backpacking is n't necessarily difficult .
But it requires more preparation and gear than camping , which usually means pitching a tent in a car-friendly campsite , cooking s'mores in a fire pit , and doing day hikes .
Compared to the rigors of backpacking , campers enjoy relative luxuries such as outhouses , potable water and picnic tables .

By contrast , backpackers strap everything onto packs , then hike away from the trailhead to set up camp in the wilderness .
They filter water from streams .
They eat trail mix , turkey jerky or easy-to-prepare food -- dehydrated soup , instant oatmeal and other meals cooked on lightweight stoves .
They sit on logs , write in diaries , play cards , read paperbacks or simply savor the silence , stars and scenery .

My husband introduced me to backpacking eight years ago with a trip to California 's Lost Coast , the rugged , remote stretch of mountains and beaches about 250 miles northwest of San Francisco .
We woke at dawn and had a remote beach to ourselves -- no other people in sight , only sea lion pups and shorebirds .
We vowed to go backpacking at least once a month ( except in the winter ) .

We took a hiatus after the birth of our son , Levi , in 2005 .
But when the Sierra snow started melting in early 2006 , Levi was 10 months old , and we reached for our packs .

Our first BWB trip was a snowbound overnight excursion near a glacier in the eastern Sierra , where Levi learned to crawl on the soft floor of our tent .
Levi -- perfect child in every way , except for abysmal sleeping habits -- slept through the night for the first time .

As any desperate , bleary-eyed new parent would have , we decided to resume our backpacking schedule -- if only to sleep soundly once a month !

In the following year , we honed BWB to a science .
In the garage is a checklist of items not to leave behind ( though we often forget to look at it ) .
We have tent set-up and teardown routines , and favorite foods for dinner , lunch and breakfast .

Levi , now 2 , jumps for joy when he sees us stuffing our clothes and sleeping bags into our packs .
He shouts phrases like 'Levi , mommy , daddy -- hiking to snow on Mount Lassen ! '

He loves eating gorp ( a homemade trail mix loaded with M&amp ; Ms ) , taking naps in his backpack , playing hide and seek behind redwoods and sleeping mushed up next to his parents in a two-person tent .

We know BWB is not for everyone -- it 'd be tougher with two or more kids , or in parts of the world not blessed with California 's reliably sunny summer .
But adventuresome parents can start with the following 10 tips :

Downgrade expectations : You ca n't travel fast or far while carrying a heavy pack and a toddler .
Six miles a day with elevation gain is a 'beat-out .
' Three miles a day is manageable if you 're in shape .

The goal is to experience the wilderness with your family -- not train for an Everest ascent .
Consider gentle trails ; instead of hiking to the top of Yosemite 's Half Dome , try the lower , flatter Hetch Hetchy Reservoir .
( You 'll end up avoiding the crowds , too .

Be prepared : Besides maps , flashlights and other emergency gear , take extra warm baby clothes .
Take Baby Tylenol or other medicine in case of scrapes , stings and bruises .
Have a water pump and travel near streams .
( Breast-feeding mothers take note : You 'll drink more water than you 've ever thought possible .
) Take extra food .
Tell rangers your planned trail , number of people in party , entrance and exit dates .

Bring sherpas : We 've gone as a nuclear family but are happy to offload food and gear to accompanying friends and relatives -- especially those with strong backs .

Gear up : I carry my fits-like-a-glove North Face pack , and I strap Levi to my chest with the Ergo baby carrier .
( It fits on the front or back and is far more comfortable , lightweight and packable than anything else I 've tried , particularly external-frame baby carriers .
) Trekking poles lend stability on uneven terrain .

Take cloth diapers : Brands such as Wonderoos and FuzziBunz are absorbent , wicking and fast-drying -- no different from your fleece jacket .
If the diaper is merely wet , hang it on your backpack or tent to dry quickly in the sun , which kills odors .

Seal soiled diapers in plastic bags and carry them out .

Take care not to contaminate water sources .
National Park Service rules prohibit the disposal of human waste within 100 feet of a water source or camp site , or within sight of a trail .
The Park Service has also adopted principles from the Leave No Trace Center for Outdoor Ethics -- http : //www.lnt.org -- which recommend that human waste be buried 6 to 8 inches deep and that washing ( whether it 's baby or dishes or anything else ) be done with water carried 200 feet away from streams or lakes , using small amounts of biodegradable soap .

Some trails require hikers to haul out all human waste .
A portable container called a Wagbag is one way to do it ; depending on where you go with baby , you might be hauling it for two .

Get dirty : Campsites are full of sap , mud and bugs -- even truly vile stuff like bear scat and maggots .
Everyone gets filthy .
Wipe down the baby with a damp bandana and look forward to a long bath upon return .

Mind the crumbs : Bears and other critters will search out food , even a crumb , noodle , raisin or other baby reject .
Take care to reduce spills , and pack everything ( even toothpaste ) in bear-proof containers .

Pack small treasures : A favorite snack , book or toy goes a long way to short-circuiting a meltdown .
We bring 'Goodnight Moon, ' a harmonica and Ginger , the well-traveled stuffed dog , to maintain some semblance of routine .

Start young : My husband started backpacking as a toddler with his parents .
( Lacking our high-tech cloth diapers , they rented mules to haul disposables in and out of Wyoming 's Wind Rivers .
) Wilderness trips are great family bonding experiences .

Enjoy the difficulties : I love challenging myself physically on backpacking trips .
The sense of accomplishment and power is exhilarating .
Backpacking with a baby is even more of a rush .
I feel like an Amazon woman when I 'm carrying a 30-pound backpack and my 28-pound toddler -- a superhero who can safely deliver my child into or out of any situation , no matter the altitude or distance .

Backpacking has made me a better mother and person -- and I 'd love to see more parents on the trail !
