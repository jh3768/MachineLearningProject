LINCOLN , Rhode Island ( AP ) -- Authorities charged a man Sunday with killing his parents with a garden hoe and burying their bodies in their backyard cesspool .

James A. Soares , 24 , of Warren , Rhode Island , has been charged with two counts of murder in the deaths of his parents , James A. Soares Sr. , 60 , and Marian Soares , 53 .

James Soares appeared in Providence District Court on Monday and was ordered held without bail .
Soares said in court that he could n't afford an attorney and a public defender will be appointed to him .
A bail hearing was scheduled for August 8 .

Police would not comment on a motive but said they believe Soares attacked and killed his parents July 9 with a heavy digging tool known as a grub hoe .
Police said he then dragged their bodies into an in-ground cesspool at the family 's home in Warren , a small town southeast of Providence .
Soares lived with his parents .

' It 's incomprehensible to think that someone could kill someone that brought them into the world, ' police Maj. Steven O'Donnell said .

The couple were reported missing July 15 after they did n't show up for a family reunion .

On Saturday , police used a backhoe to dig up the Soares ' backyard and found the bodies .
O'Donnell said the grub hoe was found under the senior Soares ' body .

Police said the younger Soares was the prime suspect early in the investigation , based on police interviews .
He was taken into custody Friday .

Police would not comment on whether Soares confessed and said the investigation was continuing .

In 2002 , the elder Soares pleaded guilty to a federal charge of being a felon in possession of firearms .
He was sentenced to probation and home confinement .
