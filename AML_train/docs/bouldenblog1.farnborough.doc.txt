A great show in challenging times  - CNN.com
FARNBOROUGH , England ( CNN ) -- Farnborough marks its 60th anniversary during a year when the aviation industry is being hit hard by high oil prices and faltering economies .

Undaunted , the airshow celebrated more than half a century of aeronautical innovation with a few thrills -- like the first showing outside the U.S. of a F-22 Raptor fighter jet .

It is the cream of the crop for the U.S. Air Force and is believed to be its fastest -- and most agile -- fighter .

But despite Monday 's sunny skies , it was impossible to ignore the twin dark clouds of high oil prices and a stumbling world economy on the horizon .

But optimism remains for the long term , thanks to the emerging economies .

' People are still flying .
China is building 97 airports by 2020 .
They need to fill those airports .
They are going to have a lot of people travelling, ' Paul Edwards of Jefferies International investment bank told CNN .

Boeing got off the mark first with a deal with a list price of nearly $ 4 billion with new Middle East low cost carrier , FlyDubai .

But even heavyweight Emirates Airlines is putting on the brakes for now and will announce no new orders here .

' We have 170 airplanes on order .
We want to see how the economic conditions pan out over the next year before we go ahead .
We are still looking at our fleet and will be back in the ordering business before too long .
At this point in time , we are just catching our breath a little bit ' said Tim Clark , President , Emirates Airlines .

Just as this year 's Airshow was looking tame , Airbus pulled off a major order .

Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways put in a firm order for 55 airplanes -- including 10 A-380 superjumbos .

Etihad said it was looking way beyond worries about high oil prices and economic slowdown in the West .

' The Emirate of Abu Dhabi is investing an estimated $ 200 billion during the next 10 years to diversify away from oil-based economy and tourism is a major strand in that diversification as we move forward, ' said James Hogan of Etihad Airlines at a press conference at Farnborough .

Farnborough also goes big on military aircraft and the focus this week is how the U.S. defense budget could be affected by the upcoming election .

But the $ 60 billion airline industry is in deep trouble .
Some estimate it will lose a tenth of that value this year alone .
This means more airlines are certain to go out of business .

One of the best ways for airlines to save money is to fly the new fuel efficient planes .
The drawback is that they cost a lot of money -- something few in the industry outside the Middle East has right now .

That 's why this is one of the most challenging airshows in Farnborough 's 60 year history .
