Copenhagen: A local's view - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- Tim , 33 , is a Canadian who moved to Copenhagen in 2000 to study at Copenhagen Business School .
He has been working full-time in Copenhagen since 2004 , currently as a journalist for a bank .

CNN : Copenhagen was recently voted the world 's best city to live in -- what 's your opinion ?

Tim : It 's absolutely true !
Of course , it 's somewhat subjective .
For somebody who puts a high value on surrounding themselves with friends and colleagues who generally have a very outward , international perspective , desires a high degree of organization in both their business and personal life , likes being close to the sea , prefers biking to driving , and perhaps has one or two children but still wants to live in the city , then the high ranking of Copenhagen makes perfect sense .

CNN : Is there anything you especially like or dislike about Copenhagen ?

Tim : As a northern city , it 's a bit too cold and cloudy for my preference and the city is a bit quiet during the first part of the week , which changes from Thursday onwards .

As for the positives , Copenhagen is generally a very liberal place , which reveals itself in interesting ways .
It 's not a politically correct city , which is a relief to me .
I do n't mind a bit of graffiti from time to time or hearing a bit of noise on the streets at night .
I love that people can have noisy parties until very late into the night .
People generally respect this freedom by not abusing it .

The city has an enormous capacity to surprise .
Copenhagen stages exceptional annual music festivals , such as the Distortion Festival , and excellent independent film festivals , public events like free cinema in the park in the summer , and so on .

CNN : How would you describe Copenhageners ' attitude to life ?

Tim : I would say Danes ' ability and willingness to socialize is probably quite underrated .
It 's not something that is visible at first glance as it 's often done in a distinctly Danish way .
Some think that just because Danes are n't Latin or Mediterranean in their way of being that they are closed people .
I would disagree .

Copenhageners manage to find a balance between their personal and work lives and they know how to make the city part of their life -- how to 'use ' the city .
Go around the city on a hot summer day to get an idea of how this works .

CNN : The political climate in Denmark has moved to the right in recent years -- is that something that 's noticeable in Copenhagen ?

Tim : If a person spent several years in Denmark without really reading the newspapers or listening to the news , I have my doubts that this shift is something that would be easy to detect .

In many respects , Copenhagen has opened up , in spite of this apparent political shift to the right .
There are far more foreigners working in Copenhagen than ever before , a result of more and more companies employing foreigners and even making their official business language English .

The right-wing definition of 'Danishness ' is something that relatively few Copenhageners can relate to and voting patterns in Copenhagen bear this out .
It 's really the right-wingers who need to be integrated into Danish society .

CNN : Could you describe a typical Copenhagener 's weekend ?

Tim : The weather has an enormous impact , far more so than in many other cities in other countries .
One reason is the short shopping hours ; on Saturday afternoons downtown shops close at 5 p.m. and the other shops close at 2 p.m. Shops are closed all day on Sundays , except on the first Sunday of the month .

On Sunday , if the weather is cloudy , rainy or cold , the possibilities for getting out are limited during the day .
Of course , Sunday brunch at a caf&eacute ; is popular .

In the evening it 's a different story .
Copenhagen is buzzing until the early hours of the morning .
You can get a drink at plenty of places until 5 a.m. and even then there are a few after-hours places to go to .
Not that I would necessarily recommend the after-hours experience !

Just as many people light candles , invite friends over and talk and drink until equally late .

CNN : It 's a pricey city -- is it possible to visit on a budget ?

Tim : It 's not impossible .
Of course , the better the weather , the easier it is .
The main budget-killers for tourists are eating and sleeping .
To do this cheaply , creativity is required ( and probably sleeping in a hostel ) .

It 's easy to cover Copenhagen on foot ( if you do n't want to rent a bike ) .
The famous Danish open-faced sandwiches ( 'sm&oslash ; rrebr&oslash ; d ' ) are cheap and widely available -- just be sure to pick one of the nondescript places where the locals go .
And you can always buy a cheap cold beer or two from a supermarket when you get tired of walking , then sit in Nyhavn alongside the tourists drinking expensive beers , or in a park .

Alternatively , dark and dingy Danish bodegas are found everywhere in the city and they are an authentic experience and always serve cheap beer .
They are filled with down-to-earth locals who , in spite of the cold stare you may receive upon entering , will inevitably prove friendly .
When you 're stumbling home , grab a cheap late-night 'poelser ' ( hot dog ) or falafel , just as the locals do .

There are plenty of interesting sites to see without opening your wallet .
My recommendations would be Christiania , the swimming area at Islands Brygge ( where you can take a dip in the cool , clean salt-water of the Copenhagen channel ) , or rent a bike and head north along the coast towards the beaches in Klampenborg and beyond , while looking at the magnificent houses along the way .

And for the cost of a cheap public transport ticket you can ride the harbor boat-bus around the entire channel and see the same sites as the tourist boats ( and even hop off and on along the way ) .

CNN : If Copenhagen was a person , what would she or he be like ?

A hipster with a few tattoos -- no question about it !
And they would be the coolest person in the place .
London or Paris ( as people ) would certainly think they were coolest and they would most certainly try to act it .

But that moment when they were standing outside trying to hail a cab to get home ( probably around midnight or 1 a.m. ) , as Copenhagen cycled by them with friends on the way to the next watering hole -- well , the fa&ccedil ; ade of London or Paris as 'coolest ' would be revealed for what it is .
