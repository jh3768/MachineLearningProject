This month's show: business on a budget - CNN.com
LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- Almost every industry is feeling the effects of the credit crisis .
With belts being tightened , the way in which we travel for our business is also changing .
On this month 's CNN Business Traveller , we 're looking at doing business on a budget .

CNN 's Adrian Finighan presents the show from Oslo -- the most expensive city in the world , according to Swiss bank UBS in their most recent survey .
Anyone visiting the city will most certainly feel the pinch .
During the course of the program , Adrian will try and keep costs to a minimum - flying Economy , staying in a budget hotel and using public transport .

We look at how travel managers are keeping a closer eye on expenses and how the hotel industry is coping .

Airlines have been hit harder with the price of oil per barrel above $ 120 , reaching as high as $ 135 .
Every dollar increase in the price of oil drives up aviation industry costs by about $ 1.6 billion .
There is great concern for the future and airlines are doing all they can to save money .

We speak to airline CEOs Jean-Cyril Spinetta of Air France-KLM , British Airways ' Willie Walsh BA , Ola Strand of SAS Norway , and Richard Branson , chairman of Virgin Group about the measures they 're taking to weather this economic storm .

One sector of the aviation industry that is looking forward to the future is private air travel .
It has seen record numbers this year in terms of orders and deliveries .
Everyone wants a piece of the action from Russia to China to Germany .

There 's also a trend to make private air travel more affordable with the launch of chartered 'air taxis ' , where in some cases flights are cheaper than business class .
We follow entrepreneur Jackie Russell using the new low-cost air taxi service 'Blink' .

Of course , the best way to keep costs down is to only travel when absolutely necessary .
We look at the latest technology in webconferencing .
It 's called Teleprescence - pioneered by Cisco and Hewlett Packard - the image of the person is life-size , in high definition and with no time delay .

We interview Cisco 's general manager of its emerging technologies group , Martin de Beers via the new telespresence system .
Adrian is in London and Martin de Beers in San Jose , CA .

Keeping to a budget should n't put you off from exploring the city you 're in whilst on the road .
With an Oslo travel pass , there are plenty of ways to explore Oslo from Sunrise to Sunset .
