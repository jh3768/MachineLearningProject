Amputee sprinter bids for Beijing - CNN.com
MILAN , Italy ( AP ) -- Double-amputee sprinter Oscar Pistorius knows he 's a long shot for the Beijing Olympic Games -- but that wo n't stop him from giving his all when he competes in Milan Wednesday in a bid to qualify .

Pistorius resumed training six weeks ago after a sports arbitration court overturned a lifetime ban from the Olympics and any other able bodied race because the IAAF says the carbon fiber prosthetic racing blades gave him an unfair advantage .

He will compete in three races -- Milan on Wednesday , Rome July 11 and Lucerne , Switzerland on July 16 -- in an attempt to qualify .
He 'll also run a 200-meter race in Lignano , Italy on July 13 'for fun, ' to work on his sprinting .

The 21-year-old must bring his 400-meter time under 45.55 seconds .
His lifetime best is 46.36 .
