Chavez makes up with king who told him to shut up - CNN.com
MADRID , Spain ( AP ) -- Hugo Chavez was on a hug-and-make-up visit to Spain on Friday , his first since last year 's infamous exchange in which Spain 's normally reserved monarch told the voluble Venezuelan leader to 'shut up ' at a summit in Chile .

Chavez arrived an hour late for an appointment at the monarch 's summer residence on Mallorca , where he was greeted by King Juan Carlos , Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos -- and watched by a mass of photographers and TV crews .

' Why do n't we head for the beach ?
' Chavez joked with the king .
The king smiled , shook hands and welcomed Chavez warmly .

After the breakfast meeting at the Marivent Palace , Chavez was to fly to Madrid for talks with Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero in the afternoon .

Officially , the trip is being billed as an opportunity to discuss bilateral relations -- but the agenda also will undoubtedly include at least some awkward references to last year 's high-level diplomatic dust-up .

In a television address to his countrymen last week , Chavez said he was ready to let bygones be bygones -- but also joked that the king ought to know it is not in his nature to sit quietly .

' I would very much like to give the king a hug, ' Chavez said in his weekly show of his Spanish visit .
' But you know , Juan Carlos , that I am not going to shut up. '

The testy exchange with Juan Carlos occurred at a summit in the Chilean capital , Santiago , in November , when the Venezuelan leader repeatedly referred to former Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar as a fascist while seated in a panel next to the king and Zapatero .

After being warned repeatedly by both Juan Carlos and Zapatero to tone down his rhetoric , the king snapped : 'Why do n't you shut up ? '

The exchange quickly made its way into newscasts and onto the Internet -- and was even marketed as a mobile phone ring tone in Spain .
Chavez demanded an apology and even said he was freezing diplomatic relations , though he never did .

After the United States , Spain is perhaps the most influential country in Latin America , with billions invested throughout the continent , and the strained relations were also a legitimate diplomatic embarrassment .

Spain had previously been on reasonably good relations with Chavez -- a major thorn in Washington 's side who has likened President Bush to the devil .

The thaw between Spain and Venezuela began in May , when Zapatero and Chavez met face to face for the first time during a summit in Lima , Peru .
In June , Spain formally invited Chavez for a visit .

The Venezuelan leader has been making headlines since he kicked off the European leg of his six-nation tour this week .

In Moscow , he said that military cooperation with Russia was proceeding 'at full speed, ' the Interfax news agency reported .
The agency also said Chavez had suggested Russia open a military base in his country , but the Venezuelan government said in a statement Wednesday that no such offer was made .

In Belarus , he praised hard-line President Alexander Lukashenko , saying their two nations shared a common resistance to 'U.S .
imperialism. ' Washington has called Lukashenko Europe 's last dictator .
Chavez also visited Portugal .
He was returning to Caracas , Venezuela , late Friday .
