I'm with the band: The Web's musical frontier - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- It appeals to the venture capitalist in all of us , whether we be a stock broker , a ruthless talent scout or a proud patron of the arts .

During the past two years , a few enterprising Web ventures have invited music-lovers to discover new talent and invest in stocks in their favorite artists .
But before dreaming about making a fortune , it pays to be a fan .

One of the first of these start-ups was Sellaband , founded in 2006 by 'fans , first and foremost -- music-lovers at heart, ' according to Dutch CEO Johan Vosmeijer .
Sellaband uses the model of the themed social networking site to rally funds in order to finance an album .

On its Web site , Sellaband says this is how it works : 'Artists upload their music and profile .
Fans find artists they like and believe in .
$ 10 ( plus transaction costs ) buys them a piece of the action .
$ 50,000 gets the artist in the studio .
Fans get an exclusive CD sent to their homes .
Artists make their dream come true. '

Every $ 50,000 quality-controlled artist is introduced to an A&amp ; R ( artist and repertoire ) consultant , a producer and a recording studio .
All income derived from advertising and music sales on the site is split evenly between the musician , the investors and Sellaband , while the company also makes money from publishing and interest on the stocks .

But Sellaband 's main draw is its friendly grass-roots structure and management , which is focused on promoting and producing unnoticed or underexposed bands , with 25 artists having sourced the full recording budget and 17 fan-funded albums released so far .

' We have a 19-year-old French chanteuse on our roster of Recording Artists , as well as a dangerous Heavy Metal three-piece from Japan -- and everything in between !
' Vosmeijer enthuses .

Sellaband 's evangelistic attitude not only encourages artists to actively promote themselves , it calls on investing 'Believers ' to spread the word , making the enterprise clearly artist-oriented and fan-based .

Nonetheless , Vosmeijer expects Sellaband to break even in autumn of 2009 , after three years of operation .

Sharing the artists

The strategy of 'crowdfunding ' -- whereby funds for a project are raised directly through individual donations from the public -- is based on the concept of 'crowdsourcing ' -- outsourcing tasks to the public , instead of using in-house employees .

Already in 2003 , the Web site ArtistShare gave fans the opportunity to fund projects by established artists in exchange for behind-the-scenes access to the creative process and other insider exclusives .

' Our mission is to ensure the creation of new art and music , despite any destructive technology that might come along -- file sharing , digital downloading , anything that will undermine an entire industry, ' Brian Camelio , ArtistShare 's founder and CEO , says on ArtistShare 's Web site .

' We believe the true value of an artist is their creative process , their creativity , not the end result. '

Slicing the pie

But what about all the artists who are n't even yet known to the general public ?

' There are some 10 million artists who have already built fan networks online, ' says entrepreneur David Courtier-Dutton , who founded Slicethepie in June 2007 .
' I saw the emergence of social networks and wanted to unlock that potential. '

Slicethepie operates according to a stock-market system of scouting , buying and trading .

How it works : Artists upload their profile and three songs to an Arena ; their music is then reviewed by paid amateur Scouts ; fans may buy Backstage Passes giving them exclusive access to an artist ; fans may buy Contracts entitling them to a return on the artist 's sales over a two-year period ; the Contracts become fully tradable on the Slicethepie Exchange .

Once the album is released , Slicethepie receives a 2-pound sterling ( $ 3.66 ) royalty on every album sale .
And with more than 7,000 artists signed by January 2008 , Slicethepie released its first fan-funded album ( The Alps ' 'Something I Might Regret ' ) this March .

And because these guys take their business seriously , Slicethepie focuses solely on smart fan filtering and sound professional financing , delegating the rest to their specialized partners .

' We sit anywhere in the industry, ' says Courtier-Dutton .
' We partner with labels , social networking sites and online businesses , and leave the rest to marketing agencies , tour managers , etc.'

World without music moguls

Back in 2005 , the online game Fantasy Music League first challenged participants to role-play music-label mogul for the chance to win cash and prizes .
No wonder the game is now obsolete , as major labels are progressively losing their grip on the increasingly online industry .

' Most of the traditional labels continue to treat the Internet as a threat and not see it as an opportunity, ' Vosmeijer says .
' They are afraid to change and keep holding on to that little bit of power they still think they have. '

' It 's the fans who make you , and not someone saying we 're going to sign so-and-so , because we think he 'll make us take a punt, ' says Sellaband recording artist Francis Rodino on Sellaband 's Web site .

Fellow artist Julia Johnson adds on the Web site : 'There 's no sitting down and saying , we will package you like this. '

' Most bands make no money for major labels ; a few superstars cover the losses for the others, ' says Courtier-Dutton , whose Slicethepie repertoire promises to be an all-star team .

The appropriately named NoMoguls , launched by music lawyer Andrew Lewis in 2008 , is the latest addition in the fans-for-bands family of music stock-broker Web sites .
Although written in legalese and very UK-oriented , the site also proposes an interesting twist on the distribution of its artists ' albums -- vinyl .

We 'll see how well the online music industry 2.0 meets analogue media , as NoMoguls is due to release its first two fan-funded albums in early 2009 .

Peppered prospects

Meanwhile , not all artists with social-networking fans are embracing the online surge in band stocks .

' Is it really a solution if an artist is chosen by the number of votes , or by the sum invested in him ?
' retorts Pierre Fa , of the French indie band Peppermoon .

' If it 's the largest number that decides , then an unknown C&eacute ; line Dion will get the album much more surely than an unknown Bj&ouml ; rk .
Are the bands who drum up the most votes the best musicians ?
As long as the only criteria for selection is a number , this process can not be valid. '

He regrets the days when the public discovered an album only at the moment of its release , as a true surprise .

' Now , we have to expose our mock-ups , our work phases , and that takes away from the freshness of the songs, ' he says .
' It is nice to share this with the fans , but at the same time , it sort of takes away the magic , do n't you think ? '

Whether an embittered band-member or a lucid luddite , Fa is true to the old-fashioned way of doing business -- from the heart .

' People who just want to make money do n't stick around in the music industry, ' he says .
' The small independent labels who are fighting to survive in 2008 are the ones who are truly passionate about what they do , because that 's the only way it can be done. '
