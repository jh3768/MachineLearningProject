Centrica eyes controlling stake in Belgium's SPE - CNN.com
BRUSSELS , Belgium ( AP ) -- Centrica says it would pay $ 820 million for a controlling stake in Belgium 's SPE from Gaz de France ( GDF ) .

Britain 's largest energy supplier said Wednesday it would pay GDF in cash for its 25.5 percent stake , bringing Centrica 's holding in Belgium 's second-largest electricity company to 51 percent and valuing SPE at just over $ 1.59 billion .

The rest of SPE is owned by Belgian banks and local government .

GDF , controlled by the French government , had to sell off the business in order to win European Union antitrust approval to combine with Suez and form one of the world 's largest energy companies .

SPE is the only major rival to Suez ' Belgian electricity unit Electrabel , SA with just 20 percent of the power market .
