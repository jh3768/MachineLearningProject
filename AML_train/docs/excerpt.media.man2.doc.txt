Excerpt: American newspapers don't have to be boring - CNN.com
Those who are fortunate enough to embed themselves for a time in the lively revelry of the British newspaper tradition -- as I did once at The Daily Mail of London under David English , the legendary Fleet Street editor -- are never again able to blindly accept the solemn tenor of its American counterpart .
There is method to the madness of the British method --- though no one should underestimate the measure of madness .
Even so , their way is often so much fun .

To quote the great British playwright and wit Oscar Wilde : 'Life is too important to be taken seriously. '

The crusty old curmudgeons of the US press had realized one day , however , that other folks liked to be entertained , so they begrudgingly began to allow gossip in the paper , just as long as it was clearly labeled for what it was .

As a deputy editor of late and sometimes lamented Los Angeles Herald Examiner paper , back then under the editorship of Jim Bellows , I occasionally was asked to look at gossip items before they went to press .
This was a wise thing to do , particularly in the case of the newspaper 's gossip columnist , because not only was he a wildly imaginative ( !
) fellow , but he had been trained in the British tradition , where almost anything goes ( i.e. , if a story item can not be conclusively proven to be false , it may just be true -- and thus is inherently and imminently publishable ) .

And so one morning at the struggling Hearst paper , trailing as it was in the deep shadow of the mighty Los Angeles Times , I arrived bright and early at the office to the sound of the great Bellows bellowing out to me , 'Tom !
Good Lord !
Look at PAGE TWO !
' This was how we had labeled our gossip page .

I immediately figured that the commotion had something to do with some amazing item !
I grabbed the paper on my desk .
There , shouting out from page two , was one of the weirdest headlines one would ever get to see : 'Hit a Pet !
' Next to that was a picture of the cutest little dog ever , and then the caption : 'Are you having trouble sleeping at night because the dog in the alley thinks he 's Pavarotti ?
Has the cat next door made your favorite petunia bed his personal potty ?
Hit-a-Pet can help !
No more frustrating exchanges with pet owners who just do n't care .
Hit-a-Pet takes care of all of your furry problems .
Call us and you 'll soon be sleeping free and easy through the night .
Squeamish about using our service ?
We take care of pet problems quietly and under the cover of darkness .
And we take Visa , Mastercard and American Express .
Just telephone us at 213 237 7000. '

Jim shouted at me through the wall , 'Tom , call that number , I do n't have the nerve. '

I dutifully dialed it .
A ring or two or three , and then the human voice representing the institution said : 'Los Angeles Times , how may I help you ? '

By then , the Los Angeles Times ( our competition ) had been absolutely flooded with outraged phone calls from pet lovers and animal rights organizations alike .
It was two hours until we could remake the edition .
Being the serious , ethical American paper that we were , we of course published a formal apology and publicly retracted the item , as well as reprimanded the gossip writer .

Well , I did not reprimand him ( I thought the gig was absolutely hilarious but , then again , I had worked a little stint on Fleet Street !
) but I think Jim Bellows might have warned him not to do anything like that again but had to try hard not to die laughing .

The truth is , the 'Hit a Pet ' stunt was damn funny .
It was the kind of gleeful absurdity that you rarely got in American newspapers .
In America , you are virtually guaranteed a spanking from the boss for even attempting to pull off something like that .
What dull lives of quiet desperation most US journalists live !
