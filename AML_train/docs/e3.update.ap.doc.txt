E3 brings more sequels, upgrades - CNN.com
LOS ANGELES , California ( AP ) -- One word sums up the announcements made by the Big Three gaming companies at the E3 this week : more .

During their flashy press conferences , Microsoft , Nintendo and Sony all announced plans for more games , more sequels , more exclusives , more connectivity and more ways for gamers to use their systems for stuff other than gaming .

Such an escalation in enhancements is undoubtedly good news for existing owners of the Xbox 360 , Wii and PlayStation 3 consoles , as well as their handheld counterparts .

However , the upgrades may leave the systems feeling less distinct than ever before .
Similar features and comparative accessories could confuse financially strapped consumers looking to power up this holiday season .

Microsoft kicked off E3 Monday at the Los Angeles Convention Center with a ceremony pitching the Xbox 360 as family-friendly .
Perhaps the biggest announcement was a redesign of the console 's interface , which will allow users to create avatars that can interact with each other and play select games online .
The Wii 's already had that feature -- called Miis -- since its 2006 debut .

The parallels only begin there .
Microsoft also flaunted 'Lips, ' a new sing-along game similar to Sony 's popular 'SingStar ' franchise .
Unlike 'SingStar, ' this karaoke game developed by iNiS enables wannabe singers to croon their preexisting tunes from MP3 players and to bust moves with a microphone that 's motion sensitive , a feature that 's been a hallmark of the Wii .

The next day at the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood , Nintendo unveiled WiiSpeak , a 'community microphone ' that attaches to the top of the console 's sensor bar and will allow users to vocally chat .
The WiiSpeak accessory will cost $ 29.99 and be available later this year .
Both the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 already feature voice chat capabilities and their own headset microphones .

Nintendo teased the news that new entries in the decades-old 'Mario Bros. ' and 'Zelda ' franchises were currently in development .
And for the first time , Nintendo will bring the 'Animal Crossing ' series to the Wii with 'Animal Crossing : City Folk ' later this year .
The cutesy open-world game will boast a bigger playing field and an online auction house selling virtual items .

' You 're able to just do all the things you love to do in 'Animal Crossing ' but even more, ' said Cammie Dunaway , vice president at Nintendo .
' And particularly with the new WiiSpeak peripheral , it just opens up the experience , so that you can be playing in a roomful of people , talking to people somewhere across the world. '

At the end of their press conference , Nintendo struck up 'Wii Music ' -- yet another play-along music game but one that uses the Wii 's controls instead of instrument-shaped peripherals like 'Rock Band ' and 'Guitar Hero .
' Nintendo 's game will give makeshift musicians the ability to conduct an orchestra as well as simulate playing 40 instruments .
That 's 36 more than 'Rock Band. '

Later at the Shrine Auditorium on Tuesday , Sony debuted its long-awaited video download service for the PlayStation 3 .
Standard and high definition videos from such studios as MGM , Fox , Lionsgate and Disney can be downloaded and watched on the console and transferred to Sony 's PlayStation Portable handheld system .
Rentals cost $ 2.99 to $ 5.99 while purchases range from $ 9.99 to $ 14.99 .

Microsoft announced a deal the day before with DVD rental company Netflix which will allow Xbox 360 owners to stream videos from Netflix to their TV .
Microsoft launched its own video download service two years ago with programming from providers such as Paramount Pictures , MTV Networks and Warner Bros. Lionsgate and Disney since used the service to dispense their content , too .

Sony surprised some spectators at E3 by announcing it would focus on and reduce the price of the 80-gigabyte PlayStation 3 to $ 399 .
Previously , the company sold a 40-gigabyte version for that price .
Before E3 began , Microsoft revealed it would cut the price of 20-gigabyte Xbox 360 by $ 50 to $ 299 .
The company will also begin selling a 60-gigabyte version for $ 349 .

Microsoft and Sony used part of their press conferences to showcase a crop of upcoming sequels .
Microsoft will unleash role-playing game 'Fable 2 ' and third-person shooter 'Gears of War ' 2 later this year .
Sony sequels due in time for the holidays include follow-ups to 'Resistance ' and 'Motor Storm .
' The first next-generation 'God of War ' game will be released next year .

' Franchises like 'Resistance ' and 'MotorStorm ' that did so many key things for us at launch are going to be very key for us this holiday season , with 'Resistance 2 ' and 'MotorStorm Pacific Rift,' ' said Jack Tretton , chief executive at at Sony Computer Entertainment America , following the Sony press conference Tuesday .

In what may have been E3 's best-kept secret , audible gasps were heard from the audience Tuesday when Nintendo announced that Rockstar Games was developing a 'Grand Theft Auto ' title for the portable Nintendo DS system that would be released in winter .
Titled 'Grand Theft Auto : Chinatown Wars, ' the game will be set in Liberty City and focus on the Triad crime syndicate .

While the Big Three presented much more of the same , they also used E3 to show off completely different products .
Microsoft demonstrated a game that uses a video camera to transport players inside B-movies while Nintendo showed off Wii Motion Plus , which adds more precision to the Wii Remote .
Sony is betting the new user-generated puzzle game 'LittleBigPlanet ' will be a blockbuster .
