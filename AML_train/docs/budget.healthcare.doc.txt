Obama seeks tax hike, higher Medicare payments  - CNN.com
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Obama will ask wealthy Americans to deal with a tax increase and pay higher Medicare premiums to help fund a $ 634 billion health care 'reserve fund ' aimed at reforming the system , according to senior administration officials familiar with the budget being unveiled Thursday .

The reserve fund will essentially be a piggy bank to be used only for reforming the system by cutting costs and trying to deal with the 46 million Americans without health insurance .

The budget will leave the actual details of how to reform the system to be worked out by Congress , and top Obama officials are already acknowledging this is only a start -- it will take more money to get the job done .

' This is a substantial down payment for health-care reform, ' one senior administration official said of the president 's plan .

In order to raise $ 8.1 billion for the health-care fund , the president is going to ask 1.5 million wealthy senior citizens to dig deeper into their pockets to pay more for their own prescription drugs starting in 2011 , according to officials .

This affects seniors earning over $ 170,000 a year who already pay more for Medicare 'Part B, ' which covers doctors ' visits , and who will now be asked to pony up more for Medicare 'Part D, ' which covers the prescription drug program created by former President George W. Bush .

In order to raise $ 318 billion for the health-care fund , the administration will raise the tax liability of wealthy Americans earning at least $ 250,000 a year by limiting how much they can write off for itemized deductions such as mortgage insurance and charitable contributions .

Top Obama officials use the example of billionaire Bill Gates to make their point , noting that if he wanted to deduct $ 10,000 in mortgage interest , at a tax rate of 35 percent he would currently get a tax break of $ 3,500 .
Under the Obama plan , Gates would only get to write off 28 percent , thus getting a tax deduction of just $ 2,800 .

The administration projects it will raise another $ 176.6 billion over 10 years for the health-care fund by adding efficiencies to the Medicare and Medicaid programs .

Knowing full well that Republicans will use a familiar charge by claiming this is a 'tax-and-spend ' budget , Obama officials are pushing back by noting they are just raising taxes for the top 5 percent of Americans while 95 percent of Americans got a tax cut with the recent stimulus plan .

Obama officials add that they inherited an annual budget deficit of about $ 1.3 trillion and need to find a way to raise revenue to invest in the future .
' We were left with an unsustainable fiscal course, ' said one top official .
