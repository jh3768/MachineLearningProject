Resume blunders that will keep you from getting hired - CNN.com
Resumes are tricky : If done well , they can put you in the running for a job ; if done poorly , they end up in the hiring manager 's recycling bin .
They should be easy since you 're just talking about yourself .
No one knows your work history , qualifications and skills better than you .
Unfortunately , they are hard work .

Making years of experience fit on one or two pages is no easy task .
Yet , while there is no one way to craft the perfect resume , there are some moves guaranteed to hurt your job hunt .

Here are some resume blunders you should avoid at all cost .

Forgetting the employer 
Although the resume is about you , it 's not for you .
After all , if you were the intended audience , you would n't bother sending it out .
The resume is meant to show prospective employers why you 're the perfect match for the job .

They want to see the skills , experience and qualifications mentioned in their job postings .
If you have skills that do n't line up exactly with the position but you know are transferable , make that clear in the resume .

Do n't assume they 'll infer what you mean , because if they do n't , you wo n't be considered for the job .

Not using keywords 
Keywords , like career summaries , are signs of the time .
Today , many employers use software to scan submitted resumes for keywords that suggest an applicant is a good match for the job .

Although you wo n't know which exact words the software is looking for , a job posting can give you a good idea .
Incorporate phrases and terms from the posting , and see what words reappear in several industry ads .
Concrete terms such as 'infrastructure development ' and 'strategic planning ' will fare better than generic phrases like 'hard worker ' and 'team player. '

Using an objective instead of a career summary 
An advantage of updating your resume regularly is that you can not only update your skills and accomplishments but also its format .

For example , just five or 10 years ago most resumes included an objective at the top .
These days , the career summary has taken its place .
Like an objective , the summary should give the employer an idea of who you are , except it allows you to focus more on your experience than on your goals .
You can briefly mention your career highlights , including past roles and your strongest skills .

Not proofreading 
Typos and grammatical errors on a resume are the textual equivalent of showing up at an interview chewing gum and wearing tennis shoes .
A resume full of mistakes suggests you care neither about the quality of your work nor the impression it makes .
An employer wants someone who produces exemplary work and will be an excellent representative of the company .

Lying 
Embellishing is a common practice that rarely impresses hiring mangers because they 've seen it all .
They know ' childcare leadership executive ' means ' babysitter. '

Outright lies , however , have no place on a resume .
For one thing , it 's not hard to verify any information you put down , so you could get caught at any point between submitting your resume and getting a job offer .
Plus , it 's a small world , and the truth has a way of coming out when business associates bump into one another at conferences .
If your boss mentions your name to your supposed former supervisor only to be told you never worked there , you could get fired .

Not keeping up appearances 
Before an employer even reads your resume , he or she forms an impression based on how it looks .
It 's a snap judgment that ca n't be avoided - after all , do n't you immediately zone out when you receive an e-mail that 's one huge block of text ?

Make your resume visually appealing by using bulleted lists , plenty of white space and subheadings .
Also , avoid fonts that are full of distracting swirls and colors .
It does n't matter how well-written your resume is if no one wants to read it .
