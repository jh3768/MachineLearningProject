Negotiating the cultural maze - CNN.com
LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- As any modern business executive knows , the hardest part of working outside your own country can be negotiating the maze of codes and values that govern work -- as well as life -- in that culture .

And , as many businesspeople have learned to their cost in the past , despite London 's pre-eminence as a European business center , there can often be few people more mysterious than the British .

To help executives learn the dos and don'ts of the culture , a leading business school in the British capital has set up a series of events to teach overseas luminaries more about the culture .

The London Program , a two-day event which took place at the Cass Business School late last year and will be repeated this March , is part of a wider trend of culturally-based courses offered by schools around the globe .

For example , the Tippie School of Management at the University of Iowa , offered a special initiation course for new students from overseas countries last year , bringing in an etiquette expert to teach them , for example , the correct cutlery use during each course of a business lunch .

' Because so many of our students come from so many different countries , they come with significant differences in their cultural backgrounds , especially in areas like etiquette, ' explained Gary Gaeth , associate dean of the Tippie School .

The Cass program takes business executives , as well as a smattering of foreign diplomats , through much of English and British culture , everything from the way the country is governed to how its people tend to view themselves .

At the first event , academics including history professor-turned television star Dr. David Starkey led the group through a potted history of the British state , its cultural make-up and society .

A group of serving lawmakers gave their views on the current political climate , while senior journalists gave an overview of the media .

On a more business-focused level , other experts led the students through things like the way global financial markets work in London , the country 's competition policy and corporate governance issues .

Additionally , they had some guidance on that most delicate of subjects -- the national character .

Kate Fox , author of a well-regarded book called Watching the English : The Hidden Rules of English Behavior , gave them an insight into notion of 'Englishness. '

' There are hundreds of unwritten social rules that we English obey without thinking -- but that to foreigners can be confusing and often infuriating, ' she noted .

' The English sense of humor alone can be a minefield for foreign executives trying to do business here .
I tried to provide some insight into our bizarre quirks , habits and reflex reactions. '

Students also went on visits to the Houses of Parliament and financial centers , and attended a series of dinners .

One attendee said afterwards he found the course 'useful and stimulating. '

' It created a great synergy and flow so one came away with both the sense of the idiosyncrasies of the market and how to deal with them, ' he added .
