Relive events that paved Obama's way to the White House - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- The world will be watching as Barack Obama is sworn in as president of the United States of America .
In anticipation of the inauguration , reporter John Zarrella , photojournalists Dominic Swann and Greg Kilday and I traveled to some of the landmark sites of the civil rights movement to reflect on events that helped shape this historic moment .

Here are some of the highlights of our Southern Civil Rights Tour -- aka Road to the White House trip .
This itinerary is no way exhaustive , but it allows for an educational and easy driving tour , starting in Little Rock , Arkansas , and ending in Montgomery , Alabama .

Little Rock Central High School

This historic school looks the same as it did in the famous black-and-white photos from 1957 .
Central High was the school where nine black students tested Brown v. Board of Education , the U.S. Supreme Court decision that paved the way for the end of segregation .

Arkansas Gov .
Orval Faubus rejected orders to desegregate the school and sent the Arkansas National Guard to prevent the black students from attending .
In light of Faubus ' statements on television , a white mob kept the students out of the all-white school until President Dwight Eisenhower federalized the National Guard troops and sent the 101st Airborne into Little Rock .
The elite Army unit spent weeks escorting the nine students to class .

At the visitor center across the street from the school , a permanent exhibit is dedicated to the crisis .
There is no charge to enter , and the center is open daily from 9 a.m. to 4 : 30 p.m. The two-room exhibit includes several interesting films that explain the plight and the players .
The high school remains in session , despite being within a national historic site .
Advance arrangements are required for a tour of the school .
Call 501-374-1957 , or visit a Web site about the school 's national historic site here .

After a visit to Central High School , drive over to 1207 W. 28th Street to glimpse the home of Daisy Bates , who was known as the protector of the Little Rock Nine .
She was Arkansas ' NAACP president , and her home became a refuge for the students .
Although a historic landmark , the house is not open to the public .

National Civil Rights Museum

Two hours away , in Memphis , Tennessee , the National Civil Rights Museum is a must-see .
The museum , at 450 Mulberry St. , is attached to the Lorraine Motel , where the Rev .
Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated .

The museum will captivate visitors ' interest for an entire day .
The exhibits begin with slavery and end with recent international human rights movements in a space across the street in the building from which James Earl Ray shot King .

The tour is a chronological walk through history with many interactive displays .
In one exhibit , visitors board an old Montgomery , Alabama , bus in which the driver orders people who sit at the front to go to the back of the bus , the same way African-Americans would have been required to do during segregation .

Museum visitors can also look into the room where King was staying on April 4 , 1968 .
Room 306 looks just as it did on the day of King 's murder .
This museum is well worth the admission fee of $ 12 for adults and $ 8.50 for children .
For two extra dollars , there 's an excellent audio tour .
The museum is closed Tuesdays .

University of Mississippi

Just over an hour south of Memphis is Oxford , Mississippi , the home of the University of Mississippi , or Ole Miss , as it is affectionately called .
In 1962 , one brave black American , James Meredith , changed 114 years of tradition .
When Meredith entered the all-white university , a mob was waiting for him .
While federal marshals protected Meredith , the crowd threw rocks and bottles , and a melee ensued .
The incident resulted in the deaths of two people and more than a hundred people injured .

Walking among the diverse student body today , visitors have to look purposefully to see the past .
The restored Lyceum building is where Meredith registered for classes .
In front of the stately building is a circle where the protesting students gathered .
Signs mark other significant areas on campus .

Bryant 's Grocery

Southwest of Oxford -- about a two-hour drive away -- is Money , Mississippi .
It is easy to drive right past the grocery store at the center of the 1955 Emmett Till tragedy .
Bryant 's Grocery changed its name to Young 's , and the dilapidated building is still standing , barely .

This is the store where a 14-year-old black boy 's encounter with the white female proprietor cost him his life .
Witnesses say Till whistled at Carolyn Bryant in the store .
Bryant 's husband and his half-brother brutally attacked and killed Till .
There 's not much else in Money , but you may find it worth a quick stop before time turns this landmark into an empty lot .

Medgar Evers ' house

Continuing south , the next stop is Jackson , Mississippi , about two hours from Money .
The house of Medgar Evers , the NAACP 's first field officer , is here .
Evers and his wife , Myrlie , established NAACP chapters throughout Mississippi .

At 2332 Margaret Walker Alexander Drive , this unassuming house is in the middle of an active neighborhood .
The house is the only one on the block without a front door , as the Everses thought it was safer to enter through the carport .
Unfortunately , this precaution did n't deter Evers ' assassin .
Medgar Evers was killed in his carport June 12 , 1963 .

The interior of the home provides a good idea of how this family lived in fear .
The children 's mattresses are on the floor to avoid bullets shot into the home through a window .
To access the home , visitors must contact Minnie Watson ( mwatson @ tougaloo.edu or 601-977-7839 ) .
Watson will gladly open the house and answer questions about Evers , who she said 'did more for the state of Mississippi than any other civil rights advocate .
' There is no cost , but donations are appreciated .

National Voting Rights Museum and Institute

It 's a three-hour drive east to Selma , Alabama , where Bloody Sunday and the Selma-to-Montgomery 1965 voters rights march took place .
What better location to visit on our Road to the White House trip than the National Voting Rights Museum and Institute , which is at the foot of the Edmund Pettus Bridge at 1012 Water Ave. The museum is a tribute to the foot soldiers who took part in these monumental events .

In the museum , the 'I Was There Wall ' is a place where march participants can leave messages , and there is a map highlighting Selma 's historic district .
The map includes locations such as the Dallas County Courthouse , where many African-Americans unsuccessfully tried to register to vote .
Entrance to the museum is $ 6 for adults and $ 4 for children and seniors .
It is closed on Sundays .

National Historic Trail to Montgomery

Go over the bridge on Highway 80 for the final 50-mile stretch of road into Montgomery .
This route is now a National Historic Trail , and the Lowndes County Interpretive Center is along this road between Selma and Montgomery .
Click here for more information on the trail and other historic sites operated by the National Park Service .

Montgomery provides a great bookend to a civil rights tour .
Not only did the Selma-to-Montgomery march end there in 1965 , but in many ways , the civil rights movement also began there with the Montgomery Bus Boycott in 1955 , which signaled the emergence of King as a civil rights leader .
In downtown Montgomery , the Rosa Parks Museum , named after the woman who inspired the boycott after she refused to give up her seat for a white passenger , provides engaging displays about the boycott and civil rights .

To make the most of this trip back in time , you may want to purchase a civil rights travel book such as 'Weary Feet , Rested Souls ' by Townsend Davis .
And do n't forget to ask the locals where to eat ; you will find some great barbeque and Southern home cooking on your travels .
