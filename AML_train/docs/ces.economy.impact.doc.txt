CES and the recession: What was the impact? - CNN.com
LAS VEGAS , Nevada ( CNET ) -- There are probably a lot of different ways to measure how the deepening recession has impacted the Consumer Electronics Show , but in Sin City , it stands to reason that one of the best is how much business the local strip clubs are getting .

In an entirely unscientific survey , then , my conclusion is that CES was hit hard by the downturn , at least if the experience of one local taxi driver is any indication .

' We taxi drivers , we 've got a thing with the strip clubs , where we get a kickback...so it 's big money if we can get the guys to go to the strip clubs, ' said Darryl , a 54-year-old cab driver who asked that his last name not be used .

' I went to the clubs ( during CES ) , thinking maybe I could get some guys to take them back to their hotels , but I did n't have any luck .
And a friend , he was hoping to get some strip club rides , since they pay us $ 50 a head , and he did n't have any luck...They were n't going out of their way to spend money like they normally would , for that extra type of entertainment. '

Actually , it 's been very hard to judge the effect of the recession on this show , which in the past has been one of the largest in the world .
Ask five different CES veterans what they thought , and you get five very different answers .

But over the course of the four days I 've been in town , some patterns have emerged , and in the end , I 'd say that while CES was still packed with attendees and exhibitors spread over the full breadth of the mammoth Las Vegas Convention Center and the Sands Expo and Convention Center , there were noticeably far fewer people here than in past years .

' There 's way less than in 2007, ' said Don Sherstobitoff , the owner of Okanagan Home Theaters , and a four-year CES veteran .
' I was walking around ( Las Vegas ) and it feels pretty much like a ghost town. '

Getting around town

I 've never enjoyed being at CES , and one reason is that during the show , it is impossible to get around Las Vegas .
In the past , the lines for taxis , either at the major hotels or the convention centers , have been horrendous -- easily an hour long -- and once you finally got in one , you 'd be trapped in bumper-to-bumper traffic for easily as long , even for a short ride .

This year , however , the general consensus is that getting around has been , while not exactly fluid , then at least easier , and quicker .

' It 's been ( just ) a half-hour wait for a taxi anywhere, ' said Sherstobitoff .

As I was writing this story , in fact , I walked to the taxi line by the convention center 's south hall , to head to the airport to go home , and literally hopped in a cab with zero waiting -- just an hour before the show closed down for the day on Saturday .

Clearly , the taxi economy has been a buyer 's market this year .
At the convention center , cabs are backed up nearly as far as the eye can see , even as the lines seem demonstrably shorter than in years past .

And that may be , several taxi drivers told me , because of what now seems to have been a rather large miscalculation as to how many cabs Vegas would need on the streets during CES .

' The idiots at the taxi commission put enough cabs on the street for 147,000 people, ' one 50-something white-haired cabbie told me , 'when they knew there 's only half that many .
It 's not even worth it to come to work. '

And another cabbie suggested that after the taxi companies struck major deals for advertising on the signage on top of the cars , they decided not to pull many of the vehicles off the street even when it became clear CES attendance would be down .

So how many people actually showed up ?

During the show , Tara Dunion , the senior director of communications for the Consumer Electronics Association , which puts on CES , said that 130,000 people were anticipated , just 11,000 less than the 141,000 who came last year .

But in a press release issued late Sunday night titled , '2009 International CES electrifies and elicits optimism for global economy, ' the CEA said its preliminary results showed that just 110,000 people showed up .
That is 31,000 less than last year , a hefty 21.9 percent drop .

Yet in its release , the CEA professed to being pleased with how things went .

' At its meeting on the third day of CES, ' the release stated , 'the 45 members of the CEA Board of Industry Leaders , which includes top executives from large and small manufacturers and retailers , reported to CEA staff that the 2009 International CES succeeded beyond all expectations and that CEA should strive to restrict future attendance to 2009 attendance levels. '

Perhaps the CEA 's happy face comes from its assessment of the number of companies that showed up exhibit .
In the release , it touted the 'more than 2,700 global companies , including 300 new exhibitors , ( who ) unveiled an estimated 20,000 new technology products across 1.7 million net square feet of exhibit space this week... ( and helped ) lead the way to economic recovery. '

Still , the CEA 's admission that attendance was down more than 21 percent--which was buried in the eighth paragraph of the press release , validates much of the on-the-ground assessment of what it was like by people who were at the show .

' It 's a little less cloggy , in terms of trying to get through the halls, ' said Stephen Cass , a senior editor for Discover magazine .
' You do n't feel people pressing in on you so much...Literally , you feel a little less pressure from the crowd. '

Cass , who 's been to CES four of the last five years , said that all the big companies were here -- the Panasonics , Sonys , and Toshibas of the world -- but that for many smaller outfits , the emphasis this year might well have been more on value proposition than on new glitzy features .

' It 's the other side of Moore 's Law, ' Cass said .
' This year , people are maybe looking at the 50 cents side , the economy side , of Moore 's Law , rather than the performance side. '

Others agree that the emphasis during the coming year in the consumer electronics business might well be on getting the most bang for buyers ' bucks rather than on the feature-laden products that have been so prevalent at CES in past years .

' Honestly , I think ( consumer spending on electronics ) is going to be on inexpensive things, ' said Jed Putterman , vice president of products at Cloud Engines , 'things people can get value out of. '

Not everyone , though , felt that CES 2009 was all that noticeably different than the event has been in the past .

To Jeremy Toeman -- a consultant who was shepherding four different companies in CES ' Innovations Showcase at the Sands -- the people who needed to be at CES , like retailers and media , were there in force .

' I do n't feel that the show is really 'hit ' even though people say it is, ' said Toeman .
' Our foot traffic has been phenomenal. '

Indeed , in the Innovations Showcase -- a special section of CES focusing on notable engineering and design -- the crowds were thick .
And in fact , throughout CES , there were large numbers of people .
Many tens of thousands of people add up , no matter how large a convention center they 're spread out over , and no matter if the total population is less than in the past .

But even Toeman said that he thinks that where some companies visiting CES might have sent 20 people in previous years , they may have sent just 12 or so this year .

The real impact of the recession could well be felt next year , however , he said .
That 's because companies planning on exhibiting at CES 2010 had to make their decisions about booth space by this year 's event .

' The big boys will be spending less money ' for next year 's CES , Toeman said .
' I may be wrong , but if I had to make a wager , that 's the wager I 'd take. '

Still , the gossip throughout town during CES was that the convention was markedly smaller this year .
Whether it was bartenders talking to patrons , cabbies talking to passengers or reporters talking to each other , there seemed to be unanimity that the numbers , while still large by the standards of other trade shows , were way down for CES .

But the impact on the people who depend on CES for their livelihood is hard to measure .

For Darryl , the taxi driver , the show could n't have come at a better time .
He 'd had such a dismal November and December due to a broad general drop in visitors to Las Vegas that he 'd had his cable shut off the week before CES .

He said , however , that business had been up at least 50 percent during the show , and that he hoped that at the very least , he 'd be able to get his cable turned back on .

' I 'm hopeful that this is a sign of the next few months, ' Darryl said , 'that the big conventions are back , and that the business people are going to be coming here .
If it 's not a big convention , there 's still a lot of people coming here for business meetings .
Even if it 's not normal , it 'll still be better than it 's been the last few month , and that 'll help me get back on my feet. '
