( CNN ) -- I just mentioned today 's big development in Washington : Democrats are demanding the automakers tell them what they mean to do with the billions they 're begging for .

' Until they show us the plan we can not show them the money, ' said Rep. Nancy Pelosi on Thursday .

Now there is a stroke of genius : asking for a plan .
Why did n't anyone think of this before ?
To say , you know , before we give you tons of money , you 've got to tell us what you 're going to do with it .
That way we can decide whether we ought to give you the money or not .
Because , if it 's a good plan , if it makes sense , then that 's one thing ; whereas if it 's a bad or stupid plan , then that 's something else again .

Either way , the decision to dole out the dough will actually be based on what you might call 'judgment ' and 'thinking ' rather than the 'what the heck ' principle we seem to have been using up to now .

It 's a bull 's eye .
Whichever Congressional genius came up with this bold idea -- the idea of demanding to know what automakers mean to do with the money they 're asking for -- deserves a Nobel Prize .

Just imagine having the smarts to say , after being asked for 25 billion bucks , 'um ... what for ? '

Now we 're getting somewhere .
