British Airways, Virgin cut fuel surcharge - CNN.com
LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- British Airways and Virgin Atlantic have announced they are reducing their fuel surcharges as the price of oil has plummeted .

Both airlines said the cuts , effective Thursday , reflected the lower price of oil , and BA also credited its fuel hedging policy .

It means BA passengers will pay &pound ; 30-35 ( $ 46-54 ) less on flights longer than nine hours , and &pound ; 15-20 ( $ 23-31 ) less on shorter flights , the airline said .

European services will cost &pound ; 4-5 ( $ 6-7 ) less , BA said .

Virgin Atlantic passengers will see similar reductions in the ticket price , the airline said .

The fuel surcharge helped airlines pass the high cost of oil on to their passengers .
As prices have dropped from a record high in the summer , airlines have been under pressure to cut the fee .

This the second fuel surcharge reduction for BA .
It first cut the charge in October .
