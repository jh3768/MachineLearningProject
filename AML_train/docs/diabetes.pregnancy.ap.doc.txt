Study: Diabetes before motherhood on the rise - CNN.com
LOS ANGELES ( AP ) -- The number of pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes has more than doubled in seven years , a California study found , a troubling trend that means health risks for both mothers and newborns .

And the number of diabetic teenagers giving birth grew fivefold during the same period , according to the study , the largest of its kind .

Expectant mothers who do n't control their diabetes face an increased risk of miscarriage and stillbirth .
Their babies have a higher chance of being born with birth defects .

' These are high-risk pregnancies, ' said Dr. Florence Brown , an expert on pregnancy and diabetes .
' All women with pre-existing diabetes need to plan their pregnancies. '

Brown is co-director of the Joslin-Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center diabetes and pregnancy program in Boston .
She had no role in the study , which was done by researchers at Kaiser Permanente , a California-based health care provider .

The researchers focused on health records from more than 175,000 ethnically diverse women who gave birth in a dozen Kaiser hospitals in Southern California from 1999 to 2005 .
Experts believe the findings likely reflect the overall U.S. population .

The actual number of pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes was small .
In 1999 , there were 245 such women ; by 2005 , there were 537 .
That translates to a rate that rose from 8 per 1,000 pregnancies to 18 per 1,000 .

The rate increased the greatest among 13- to 19-year-olds giving birth .
It ballooned from about 1 per 1,000 pregnancies to 5.5 per 1,000 during the seven-year period .

Blacks , Asians and Hispanics were more likely to have diabetes before pregnancy than whites .

The rise of diabetes among women of childbearing age mirrors the prevalence of the disease in the general population .
The most common form of diabetes is Type 2 , which is linked to obesity .

About 15 million people in the United States are diagnosed with diabetes , and 1.5 million new cases were diagnosed in people age 20 and older in 2005 , according to the American Diabetes Association .

Pre-pregnancy diabetes is different from gestational diabetes , which is developed during pregnancy and disappears later .
Gestational diabetes affects 3 percent to 8 percent of pregnant women in the U.S .

In the study , Kaiser researchers did not look at whether any of the women had prenatal diabetes care or how the babies fared after birth .
They also could not determine the type of diabetes the women had .

Type 2 , which is linked to obesity , occurs when the body makes too little insulin or can not use what it does produce .
Type 1 occurs when the body does n't produce insulin .

Results of the study were published online Monday in the journal Diabetes Care , a publication of American Diabetes Association , which funded the research .

' There are things women can do before they become pregnant that will increase the likelihood of them having a healthy baby, ' said lead author Jean Lawrence , a research scientist with Kaiser Permanente Southern California .

That includes controlling blood sugar levels with an insulin pump or maintaining a healthy diet and exercise routine .
Overweight women are also encouraged to shed some pounds before getting pregnant .

The North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System in New York has a special program to help moms-to-be manage their diabetes .

Women are encouraged to seek medical help at least three months before they plan to have a baby so doctors can help them control their blood sugar and increase their intake of folic acid , said program manager Marie Frazzitta .

' By the time a woman knows she is pregnant , the ( baby 's ) heart is already developed, ' Frazzitta said .
At that point , 'there 's not much we can do. '

Michelle Cangemi , who has Type 1 diabetes , was among those who sought care at North Shore before she become pregnant with her first child in 2005 .

Cangemi , who had good control of her blood sugar before pregnancy , kept an even closer eye on it while expecting .
As someone who normally checked her blood sugar four times a day , she checked 15 times a day during her pregnancy .

' It was definitely something that worried me throughout my pregnancy, ' said the 29-year-old dietitian whose daughter turned out healthy .
' You do n't know how the blood sugar levels are going to affect a child that 's developing. '

Now Cangemi is seven months pregnant with her second child .
This time she 's less nervous .

' There 's so much monitoring that it makes me feel better that everything is going to be fine, ' she said .
