How to squash workplace wars - CNN.com
For many people , the workweek is longer than the fabled 40 hours .
Working lunches and late nights can keep you at the office for the bulk of your waking hours .

Is it any wonder there 's some workplace friction once in a while ?

Like childhood siblings who ca n't help but get on each other 's nerves , officemates can push your hot buttons without even trying .
The problem is , nobody 's there to put you in separate rooms until you cool down .
A conflict can escalate from a difference of opinion to a full-fledged battle .

Sometimes no matter how willing you are to ignore the problem , you 're just ca n't .
If your mental health depends on overcoming a workplace war , it 's time to deal with it .

The other party : A co-worker

The war : Disagreements with colleagues are anything but rare .
For one thing , you probably spend more time interacting with colleagues than with anybody else .
Human nature suggests you 'll get irritated with each other at one time or another .
Factor in perceived competition for promotions and your boss ' attention , and you have the recipe for a co-worker conflict .

The solution : 'First , take a moment to plan out your course of action .
You want to take emotion out of the equation and make sure you are being proactive instead of reactive, ' says Carly Drum , a workplace etiquette expert with New York-based executive search firm Drum Associates .

Set up a meeting and have an agenda ready so you can ensure you stay constructive and on task .
The goal of the meeting should be to 'discuss how to work more effectively as a team and to discuss issues that might be posing obstacles. '

The other party : Your boss

The war : Well , you 're fighting with your boss and that 's never good .
A lot of issues factor into it , whether it 's just a difference of opinions or office politics .
Even if you do n't deal with your boss one-on-one every day , he or she influences your daily tasks and your future at the company .
It 's a tightrope walk deciding how to stand up for yourself without having to immediately pack your things and be escorted out by security .

The solution : A good boss will engage you in a dialogue about any concerns you have if you approach him or her in the right way .
Arrange a meeting to talk about what 's troubling you , Drum suggests .
' No one likes to be blindsided , especially your supervisor .
' Focus on how your concerns affect productivity and the environment at work .
' Your main goal should be to improve processes or issues within the company .
Just make sure that you do not become a 'squeaky wheel .

The other party : A C-level executive

The war : C-level executives , such as CEOs and CFOs , have a lot of power .
With that power often comes stronger personalities that can be demanding or abrasive .
In fairness , they also have more responsibility and time constraints ; sometimes you 're unfortunately on the receiving end of frustration they ca n't vent during meetings or negotiations .

The solution : Assess the situation carefully .
You want to be certain you do n't step on anyone 's toes as you try to solve the problem .
' Proper business protocol is to go to your direct boss first with a work problem, ' Drum says .

If the C-level problem is your boss , however , then contacting human resources is the safer course of action .
Use your judgment to know whether the other person is going to be receptive to a one-on-one meeting or if you should go directly to HR. Your goal should be to open a dialogue about the issue in the most diplomatic way possible .

The other party : A client

The war : If you deal with clients and vendors every day , you 're bound to get irked by something they do .
Perhaps they 're high maintenance or they 're too stubborn to listen to you - whatever the case may be , you have to deal with them .

The solution : As tricky as it is to approach a boss about a concern , it can be even more difficult to bring up the subject with the clients who are giving you business .
In fact , you should make sure it 's something you ca n't ignore before you decide to have a conversation with them .

' If discussing the problem is something that that will enhance the work product or relationship , then the conversation should happen sooner rather than later, ' Drum says .
' If the issue is simply about a passing clash of personality rather than a substantive work matter , apply common sense as to whether the disagreement even warrants discussion. '

Regardless of whom you 're not getting along with , remember that you decide what your limit is .
If remaining silent adds to your stress level instead of alleviating it , then you should speak up .
If you 're in an environment where nothing changes or your concerns are n't addressed , think about whether or not it 's a good place for you .
