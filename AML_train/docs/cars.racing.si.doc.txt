Future of auto racing a blur - CNN.com
( SI.com ) -- Predicting the future of auto racing may be a daunting -- and impossible -- task , but it helps to realize the importance of these three words :

Bigger .
Safer. Faster .

These are the three mandates that all competitive motor sports circuits seem to share .
Bigger , as in adding more fans , reaching more markets and , ultimately , making more money .
Safer , as in eliminating the deadly crashes that can turn a competitive race into a horror show while still allowing drivers to reach their maximum potential without fear of ending their lives .
And faster , as in the goal of anybody who has ever been in ear-shattering distance of a string of cars revved up to the red line on the tachometer .

But are these realistic goals ?
For instance , can Formula One , the world 's most popular open-wheel circuit , and NASCAR , the king of American motor sports competition , possibly get any bigger ?

Certainly , of course .

While the perception of some may be that NASCAR remains a regional fascination with Southern Fried characters and good ol ' boy executives , the truth is that it continues to expand into pockets that heretofore had minimal interest in big-time motor sports .

A recent column by SI.com 's Lars Anderson points out that NASCAR would like to see tracks built in Denver , Colorado ( probable ) , Seattle , Washington ( possible ) , and New York ( well ... ) , and that a decade from now , do n't be surprised if NASCAR expands globally into such areas as China and Mexico .

To do so , however , NASCAR also needs to expand its range of driver personalities and nationalities .
One key move came last summer when world-class driver Juan Pablo Montoya of Colombia announced his intention to leave the high-toned Formula One circuit to race in NASCAR 's rougher-edged Nextel Cup stock-car circuit .
The knee-jerk reaction of some motor sports enthusiasts was that Montoya -- having fallen on hard times in F-1 -- was now slumming in order to resuscitate his stagnant career .

After all , surmised F-1 faithful , who would leave the world 's most popular open-wheel series , one that includes races at exotic locales such as Australia , Europe , Asia and Brazil , to rub fenders at Talladega , Alabama , and Bristol , Tennessee , if you did n't have to ?

But maybe Montoya was n't just trying to shake up his present-day status .
Part of his decision stems from what he saw while peeking into the future .
' I 've always thought that NASCAR could be fun, ' he explained to SI 's Anderson .
' It 's getting bigger by the year. '

NASCAR , which has never had a foreign-born racer win the driver 's championship , could use someone like Montoya to succeed in order to help draw in the Hispanic market .
Similarly , other minority drivers are needed ; NASCAR would have loved the opportunity to market Danica Patrick , the It Girl of Racing who made stock-car inquiries before opting to stay ( for now ) in the Indy Racing League .
NASCAR 's Drive For Diversity program still remains a work in progress , but at least an outlet is in place .

Meanwhile , the addition of Toyota to NASCAR 's list of manufacturers this season is another example of the circuit becoming more global in recognition .
Detroit 's Big Three of Ford , GM and Dodge no longer have the market cornered when it comes to what makes of cars are racing around America 's oval tracks .
Who knows , will Mercedes or Ferrari one day step foot into the ring ?

Formula One , of course , already has a global reach , but even its fans are asking for more .
In a 2005 survey , in which more than 93,000 F-1 fans responded , 69 percent said the sport should travel to new countries , while 84 percent said the schedule should have more than the 17 races currently set for this season .

In terms of safety , NASCAR and F-1 continue to explore ways in which technology can save lives .
On March 25 , NASCAR will debut its Car of Tomorrow at the race in Bristol .
The CoT , which had its conception soon after legendary NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt died following a final-lap wreck in Daytona in 2001 , has elements such as a thicker gas tank container , sturdier roll cage and readjusted seat alignment to provide drivers with safer conditions in case of an accident .

Meanwhile , F-1 has continually sought to implement safety improvements -- usually by decreasing speeds -- since the 1994 death of its star , Aryton Senna .
In 2005 , for instance , F-1 reduced the downforce on each car by adjusting the front and rear wings and modifying the rear diffuser profile .
But the high-tech F-1 teams seem to make countermoves just as quickly to build up the speed again .
It 's a game of cat-and-mouse , thanks to that simple motivation of .. .

Speed .
That 's the name of the game in auto racing ( of course , it helps to have a little luck and to stay away from accidents ) .

The search for more speed will be the essence of auto racing 's future , just as it has been for its past and for its present .

Speed , of course , is n't always apparent in the final tally of a car 's mph .
Pit crews are constantly fine-tuning the art of working on a car when it arrives for a splash of gas and some new rubber , all in hopes of shaving tenths of a second here and there -- time that could mean the difference between Victory Lane and a seat in the back of the pack .

Track owners also tinker with their road surfaces in hopes of allowing cars to go faster and create more excitement for fans .
Las Vegas Motor Speedway owner Bruton Smith increased the banking of his track 's corners and backstretch ; consequently , drivers set track records during preseason testing .

Tires on those cars , though , had trouble dealing with that increased speed , as the rubber heated to extreme levels .
Of course , instead of finding ways to decrease the speed , Goodyear developed a tire that could handle the high temperatures .
Losing speed , you see , is not an option .

And losing speed will not be an option going forward .
Whether it 's expansion into the Far East , a more protective driver environment or technology that renders speed reduction rules obsolete , the future of motor racing has one thing in common with the product being presented on the track .

Both are moving at a blur .
