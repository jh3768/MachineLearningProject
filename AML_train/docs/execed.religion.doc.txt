Balancing faith and business - CNN.com
LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- Business schools are not only about teaching students .

They also exist to carry out research and , equally importantly , flag up emerging issues that the wider commercial community needs to be paying attention to .

The University of Pennsylvania 's Wharton school , which has topped the new Financial Times 's Global MBA rankings for another year , has just highlighted a subject that companies need to be increasingly aware of : religion in the workplace .

In the United States , one of the most prominent examples of this has been the practice of office-based prayer sessions within the administration of President George W. Bush .

Yet a Wharton study of the issue stresses that it goes beyond Christianity , also taking in the divergent needs of the varying faiths practiced by immigrant communities , both in the United States and other countries around the world .

' The old paradigm of leaving your beliefs behind when you go to work is no longer satisfying, ' said Stew Friedman , practice professor of management at Wharton and director of the school 's Work/Life Integration Project .

' More than ever , people want work that fits in with a larger sense of purpose in life .
For many people , that includes a concept of God , or something like it. '

This can bring up a series of issues , for example the faithful expounding their belief in the workplace .

Potentially controversial , it is also a tricky legal area in the United States , according to Deborah Weinstein , who teaches employment law for managers in Wharton 's legal studies and business ethics department .

' Courts across the country have interpreted this issue very differently, ' she said .

' In a 2006 case in California , the court said persistent and blatant proselytization is prohibited because it could constitute harassment .
But other courts , in Colorado , for example , have said employers need to bend over backwards to accommodate those who need to proselytize. '

When making religion compatible with work it is most sensible for employees to take some personal responsibility , according to Friedman .

' Let 's say you need to pray several times during the work day, ' he said .
' How does your being able to pray during the day make the company more effective ?
If it 's something you really care about , you 'll find a convincing way to make your case .
This inverts the normal antagonistic way of thinking about your company meeting your needs. '

Other considerations include the potential business of recruiting a staff chaplain or similar religious figure .

Companies considering this , Wharton warn , should pick someone with a relevant masters degree , specific training in drug and alcohol abuse and marriage and family counseling , and membership in a professional chaplaincy organization .

As well as a full-time appointment , such people can be hired in for around $ 125 an hour .

But as well as all the potential pitfalls , the mixing of work and faith can also have a business benefit , the study stresses .

Religion-savvy companies can avoid blunders such as the decision by fashion group Liz Claiborne to embroider verses from the Koran on the rear of its DKNY-branded jeans , something condemned by Muslims as deeply offensive .

' Cultural competence is a big buzz word right now, ' Georgette Bennett , president of the New York City-based Tanenbaum Center for Interreligious Understanding , told the study .

' But you ca n't be culturally competent without understanding something about religion , because religion is the largest component of culture .
You have to figure out how to tap into your internal diversity resources. '
