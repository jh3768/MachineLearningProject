( CNN ) -- This week , we 're focused on one theme : holding President Obama to his promise of transparency .
On Wednesday , he will outline his vision for cracking down on bailout abuse .

A demand for transparency and accountability here would seem like a no-brainer , yet there has been shockingly little applied so far to the bailout .

So how about this : not another dollar , not one , to bail out the banks until clear , no-room-for-misunderstanding rules are set for how the money can and can not be spent .

The government does n't own the banks , but the American people do own the money .
We have every right to demand limits on how it 's used , particularly after the obnoxious manner in which some on Wall Street have taken our cash and practically spit in our face as a way of saying thanks .

The president and his new treasury secretary can draw up the specifics , but if they 're looking for some starting points , how about opening the books ?

All the books must be opened and any company taking another penny must consent to an audit , waiving any legal right to block the government from stepping in .

We have the right to know what they are doing and how to keep all this from happening again .

And what about penalties going forward , real penalties for some of the outrageous behavior we 've seen ?

Misuse of bailout money must be punished if executives decide it 's more important to , say , redecorate their offices or give each other bonuses or go on some boondoggle junket , than to truly try and keep their companies afloat .

The bailout conditions must be unconditional , zero-tolerance , real accountability this time .
That 's what we hope to hear from the president tomorrow .
