U.S. at risk of cyberattacks, experts say - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- The next large-scale military or terrorist attack on the United States , if and when it happens , may not involve airplanes or bombs or even intruders breaching American borders .

Instead , such an assault may be carried out in cyberspace by shadowy hackers half a world away .
And Internet security experts believe that it could be just as devastating to the U.S. 's economy and infrastructure as a deadly bombing .

Experts say last week 's attack on the former Soviet republic of Georgia , in which a Russian military offensive was preceded by an Internet assault that overwhelmed Georgian government Web sites , signals a new kind of cyberwar , one for which the United States is not fully prepared .

' Nobody 's come up with a way to prevent this from happening , even here in the U.S., ' said Tom Burling , acting chief executive of Tulip Systems , an Atlanta , Georgia , Web-hosting firm that volunteered its Internet servers to protect the nation of Georgia 's Web sites from malicious traffic .

' The U.S. is probably more Internet-dependent than any place in the world .
So to that extent , we 're more vulnerable than any place in the world to this kind of attack, ' Burling added .
' So much of what we 're doing [ in the United States ] is out there on the Internet , and all of that can be taken down at once. '

' This is such a crucial issue .
At every level , our security now is dependent on computers, ' said Scott Borg , director of the United States Cyber Consequences Unit , a nonprofit research institute .
' It 's a whole new era .
Political and military conflicts now will almost always have a cyber component .
The chief targets will be critical infrastructure , and the attacks will emerge from within our own computer systems. '

Hackers mounted coordinated assaults on Georgian government , media , banking and transportation sites in the weeks before Russian troops invaded .
Known as distributed denial of service , the attacks employ multiple computers to flood networks with millions of simultaneous requests , overwhelming servers and crippling Web sites .

Hackers shut down the Web site of the Georgian president , Mikheil Saakashvili , for 24 hours and defaced the Georgian parliament site with images of Adolf Hitler .
Saakashvili blamed Russia for the attacks , although the Russian government said it was not involved .

Web sites and computer networks have been targeted by hackers for decades , although large-scale , coordinated cyberattacks are still a relatively new phenomenon .
Some Internet-security experts believe that the Georgia conflict marks the first time a known cyberattack has coincided with a ground war , but others said that similar computer attacks have accompanied military operations in the Middle East and elsewhere .

The challenge to U.S. security experts is that such attacks can be mounted anonymously , and relatively cheaply , from anywhere in the world .
Georgia 's attackers employed 'botnets, ' or malicious automated programs that take root undetected in far-flung computers and barrage their targets with useless data .
By last Friday , some of those botnets were originating from Comcast Internet addresses in the United States , Burling said .

' It only takes a couple of experts ; it does n't take a whole cyber infantry division to pull something like this off, ' said Don Jackson , director of threat intelligence for SecureWorks , an Atlanta-based computer security firm .
' For a very small investment in resources , you can have a huge impact. '

In the United States , government computer networks parry millions of attempted intrusions every day , Internet-security experts say .
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security created a National Cybersecurity Center this year to coordinate federal cyberdefense efforts and quicken responsiveness .
However , a recent Homeland Security Department intelligence report , obtained by The Associated Press , concluded that there are no effective means to prevent a coordinated attack on U.S. Web sites .

' When it comes to our government IT security , we 're pretty strong in protecting against [ attacks ] , ' Homeland Security spokesman William R. Knocke told CNN .
' But I would n't say ... we 're 100 percent impenetrable. '

So what would a cyberattack on the United States look like ?
And where is the U.S. most vulnerable ?
It depends on who you talk to .

Borg does not believe that the U.S. is susceptible to the kind of attacks launched at Georgia .

' We can command so much bandwidth that it 's hard to overwhelm our servers, ' he said .
' We are vulnerable to more sophisticated attacks , but right now most of the people who want to do us harm do n't have those capabilities. '

The Web sites of key government security agencies , such as the Pentagon and the Central Intelligence Agency , are difficult to bring down , experts said .
So are the computer networks of large American banks .
But experts say a successful , large-scale attack on U.S. computer systems could hobble electric-power grids , transportation networks and industrial-supply chains .

' You 'd see some disruption of essential services , like electricity .
You 'd definitely see espionage, ' said James A. Lewis , a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington .
' Would it be decisive ?
No. Nobody 's going to win a conflict with the United States in cyberspace .
But would it be disruptive and irritating ?
Yes.'

Federal researchers who launched an experimental cyberattack last year in Idaho caused a generator to self-destruct , prompting fears about the effect of a real attack on the nation 's electrical supply .

And a May report by the Government Accountability Office found that the Tennessee Valley Authority , which supplies power to almost 9 million people in the southeastern U.S. , had not installed sufficient cybersecurity measures .
Spokesman Jim Allen said the TVA , the nation 's largest publicly owned utility company , is 'on track ' to correct the problems .

What frustrates computer-security experts is that the features that make the Internet such an invaluable resource -- its openness and interconnectedness -- also make it easier for hackers to do harm .
As a staple of 21st-century warfare , cyberattacks will become increasingly sophisticated , forcing governments and private industry to build ever-stronger firewalls and other defenses , experts said .

Also , vague international laws and a lack of accountability will continue to make tracking down and prosecuting cyberattackers difficult .

' We do n't know quite what the rules are for this kind of conflict .
If it 's spying , it 's illegal .
But is it an act of war ?
And who do you arrest ?
' Lewis asked .
' We 're much safer [ in the U.S. ] than we were a year ago .
But we still have a long way to go. '
