'Mad Men' remains a show full of secrets - CNN.com
NEW YORK ( AP ) -- Let 's twist again like we did last summer !

' Mad Men ' fans remember how things were really hummin ' last summer , the first for that glorious drama series set in the Manhattan advertising world of 1960 .
There were lots of twists at the Sterling Cooper agency : Peggy 's unsuspected pregnancy , Roger 's heart attack , the double life of the man we thought we knew as Don Draper .

' Mad Men ' returns Sunday on cable 's AMC .
Now it 's February 1962 , and as the season premiere gets going , Chubby Checker proclaims 'twistin ' time is here. '

Here 's an interesting twist : 'Mad Men ' is being welcomed back with a whirlwind of attention , accelerating what had been a steady build .
Critics ' raves and the small but ecstatic audience a year ago were followed by a pair of Golden Globes and then a Peabody .

In recent weeks the show scored cover stories in Entertainment Weekly and The New York Times Magazine , while popping up in GQ and Vanity Fair .

The attention was crowned last week , when the show received 16 Emmy nominations , including a nod for best drama .

It 's a saga unfolding nearly a half-century ago , with a genre-busting absence of doctors , lawyers , cops or superheroes .
And yet 'Mad Men ' -- as contemporary and relatable as anything on TV -- seems game to become a mainstream hit .

' It 's not really 'an advertising show, ' ' says Jon Hamm , who won a Golden Globe for his performance as Draper , the agency 's creative sage .
' It 's a show about this guy and the problems he has in his relationships , his job , his life and his past -- which are problems everybody has. '

As envisioned by series mastermind Matthew Weiner , it 's also about secrets , big and little , in the modern world -- like the WASP patriarchy Draper occupies with his fellow 'Mad Men ' denizens ( played by a gifted cast that includes John Slattery , Elisabeth Moss , Vincent Kartheiser , Christina Hendricks , January Jones and Robert Morse ) .

The 13-episode season dawns on Valentine 's Day , which is celebrated in various ways .
But most of the characters also tune in first lady Jackie Kennedy 's tour of the White House -- a TV special aired that Valentine 's evening by not one but two networks and watched by most of the nation .

This is a nation where things are in flux .
Younger people are starting to call the shots .
Satisfaction is assured for 'those who think young ' ( in the words of a popular Pepsi-Cola campaign ) .

And it 's a problem for Sterling Cooper , which , instead of cola to advertise , has landed a coffee account .

' No one under 25 drinks coffee anymore, ' says account man 'Duck ' Phillips .
' Just Pepsi .
They pour it on their Frosted Flakes .
' Phillips wants to hire younger writers for the coffee campaign .

' Young people do n't know anything, ' Draper scoffs , 'especially that they 're young. '

At 36 , Draper is old school , a cool traditionalist thinking whatever the opposite of young is .
So he 's under even more pressure than last season .

' One of the big questions this year is : What makes this guy happy ?
' says Hamm .
' What makes him relaxed and comfortable ?
The beautiful wife , the mistresses , the job success and the booze and the cigarettes are n't the answer .
They 're just a kind of balm , with temporary relief. '

During a recent interview , Hamm appears happy , relaxed and comfortable .
His leading-man-handsome face is freed from Draper 's nearly constant mask of guardedness .
Similarly , his jeans , open-collared white shirt and baseball cap ( for his hometown St. Louis Cardinals ) are in marked contrast to his character 's sartorial style : the Brooks Brothers suits , the wingtip shoes , the sheen of Draper 's slicked-back hair .

Even so , 'the role was a perfect fit, ' says Hamm , who , at 37 , lends Draper the authority of someone significantly older than his years .
' I do n't know why it is : I looked old when I was 16 ! '

Not surprisingly , when he arrived in Los Angeles in his early 20s , he could n't snag the teen roles other actors his age were snapping up .

He was cast in 'The Division, ' a cop show , episodes of 'Providence, ' 'The Unit ' and 'What About Brian, ' and the film 'We Were Soldiers, ' as well as appearing in two films written by and starring his longtime girlfriend , Jennifer Westfeldt : 'Kissing Jessica Stein ' and 'Ira &amp ; Abby. '

As Draper , he says , 'I guess I caught up to my aspect , a persona I could naturally play .
It was easy for me .
And since I was relatively unknown and did n't come with a ready-made identity , it was easy for people to see me as a guy who 's mysterious -- an unknown quantity. '

Hamm thinks it 's 'incredibly fun to play a guy who has a lot of secrets ' -- while in the position of not always knowing what those secrets are .

' Matt talks about keeping things secret , even from the cast until each script is ready, ' says Hamm , chuckling at Weiner 's not-infrequent lapses .
' He 's the WORST secret-keeper -- all he wants to do is tell you about the secrets he wants you not to know about .
So I knew quite a few things about where the first season was going .
And it does help .

' This season started with the same promises of 'I 'm NOT gon na tell you anything, ' and then , of course , two weeks in , you hear : 'I have this great idea !
Let me tell you about it !

Now that 1962 is just around the corner with a new 'Mad Men ' season , so many viewers are eager to be told .
