Qantas to cut 1,500 jobs worldwide - CNN.com
SYDNEY , Australia ( AP ) -- Qantas Airways , Australia 's flagship carrier , announced Friday it was slashing its work force by 1,500 people worldwide and abandoning plans to hire 1,200 more as it tries to deal with skyrocketing fuel costs .

Chief executive Geoff Dixon said the cuts would total 4 percent of its total work force and include closing call centers in Tucson , Arizona and London , causing the loss of 99 jobs there .
About 1,300 jobs will be lost in Australia and the rest overseas .

Qantas is also abandoning plans to increase its capacity by 8 percent in the 12 months to mid-2009 , with no growth whatsoever now expected in that period , Dixon said .
Also , 22 older planes in Qantas ' 228-strong fleet would be retired .

Qantas ' budget subsidiary Jetstar would also be hit by the cuts , with its hiring program suspended , including pilots .
A Jetstar cabin crew and pilot base in the southern city of Adelaide will be shut by September .

' The jobs to be cut will be principally concentrated in non-operational areas , although operational positions will also go, ' Dixon told reporters .
' Over 20 percent of our management and head office support jobs will be cut. '

Dixon said the cuts were necessary to ensure that Qantas survives what he described as a crisis in the aviation industry caused by big rises in the price of fuel .

Fuel accounts for about 35 percent of Qantas ' expenses , and rising fuel costs are expected to add more than A $ 2 billion ( $ 1.95 billion ) to the company 's fuel bills to the year ending mid-2009 .

The first step in the job shedding plan would be to ask for voluntary redundancies , Dixon said .
