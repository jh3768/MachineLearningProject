5 things airlines won't tell you about weather delays - CNN.com
( Tribune Media Services ) -- Is your airline telling the truth about the weather ?

If you were a passenger on one of the more than 1,200 flights United Airlines recently canceled , you might have wondered -- particularly after its pilots claimed the carrier was understaffed during the peak travel period , contradicting the airline 's explanation that winter storms were to blame for its actions .

And if you had a ticket on Northwest Airlines last summer , and one of your flights was called off because of what the airline said were thunderstorms , but everyone else said was a pilot shortage , you might also have your doubts .

Heck , you do n't even have to fly to distrust an airline .
Have you seen the commercial with the pilot and the iPhone yet ?
Air traffic control says there 's a weather delay .
The pilot pulls up the weather report on his phone and finds there 's no weather problem .
The tower clears the flight .
' Everybody was happy , and life was good, ' he says .

If you 're not asking about weather delays yet , you probably will be .
This time of year traditionally brings blizzards , ice storms and cold winter rains , offering more opportunities for airlines to play the weather card .

And they almost certainly will , analysts say .
That 's because of a quirk in the way weather delays and cancellations are reported , an unusually generous definition of weather adopted by airlines and passenger contracts that are written in a way that gives airlines every incentive to blame Mother Nature .

For the record , the airlines insist they 're telling the whole truth , and nothing but the truth , when it comes to climate-caused cancellations .
Asked about its Christmastime meltdown , United Airlines e-mailed me a letter sent to employees by Pete McDonald , its chief operating officer , which explained the situation .
' Through the month of December , we were affected by significant irregular operations , particularly at O'Hare , as a result of repeated weather events , including ice , fog , wind and snow, ' he wrote .
' We also struggled through snowstorms in Denver .
In fact , weather and air traffic control delays affected United twice as much as the rest of the industry. '

That may be true , but there 's likely more to it than that , say observers .
Here are five things your airline probably wo n't tell you about weather delays :

Weather is only half of the story -- and it 's not the interesting half

' If there is a hint of bad weather anywhere , that will be used as the excuse, ' says Holly Hegeman , an airline industry analyst with PlaneBusiness.com .
But there 's often more at work .
In United 's case , a pilot shortage exacerbated by a frayed relationship between pilots and management was probably the primary cause .
' I think United looked pretty guilty the last two weeks , as American did not post similar cancellation numbers , nor did Southwest , out of O'Hare or Midway , for the same time periods, ' she says .

When we call it a weather delay , we 're off the hook

' It 's very convenient to put weather over any other shortcomings, ' says Henry Harteveldt , an airline analyst with Forrester Research .
Why ? Because under most airline contracts of carriages -- the legal agreements between you and the airlines -- weather is considered an 'Act of God ' and it basically means the carrier owes passengers nothing .
' They do n't have to offer you accommodations , meals or hotel vouchers, ' he says .
' It 's a giant loophole that the airline likes to fly through. '

We 're on the honor system when we report a weather delay

When an airline says a flight is affected by weather we have to take it at its word .
The data is reported to the government but not subjected to any kind of formal audit .
Since it first required airlines to report the causes of delays five years ago , the government has red-flagged weather delay numbers only twice .
In 2005 , SkyWest Airlines was fined $ 25,000 for 'inappropriately attributing flight delays to the National Aviation System, ' according to a consent order .
And last year , JetBlue Airways was told it had incorrectly tagged some of its winter cancellations as 'air carrier ' delays , when , in fact , weather should have been cited .
It was not fined .

Our definition of a weather delay is absurdly loose

'Squishy, ' is how Meara McLaughlin , vice president of business development for flight data site FlightStats.com , describes the new airline definition of weather .
' The definition of weather has expanded a bit, ' she says .
It is n't just the conditions at your airport , along the way , or at your destination that count , but weather anywhere in the system that can be invoked .
That 's because the airlines ' so-called 'hub and spoke ' system relies on aircraft coming from other cities , which could be affected by weather .
' To my way of thinking , you have to call that something other than weather, ' she says .
As someone who processes a lot of aviation data , McLaughlin believes airlines are applying this looser definition of weather with greater frequency .

We 're even confused by the way we report weather delays

Robert Mann , an airline analyst who has investigated how airlines report delays on behalf of the Transportation Department , says the process can even be confusing to someone inside an airline .
Each carrier has what he calls 'inherent biases ' to the way it classifies a delay .
It all comes down to who gets to report the delay internally .
' If the gate agent has the opportunity to code the delay , they wo n't code it as ( being their fault ) because they could lose bonuses or get a bad review, ' he says .
' But if you give the reporting capability to someone else , they 'll code it a different way .
' More often than not , it 's the bottom line that holds the most sway over how a delay is reported -- what kind of delay will cost an airline the least , in terms of compensation paid to passengers or on-time rankings .

So what 's a passenger to do when a flight is delayed or canceled because of a storm ?
Arguing with a ticket agent is pointless , because the agent is n't making the call -- it 's someone down the line , safely out of your reach .

Your most effective weapon is not information , but politeness .
It could get you a hotel room or a meal voucher even when you are n't entitled to one , and it could put you on the next available flight to your destination .

And next time an airline says your flight is canceled because of the weather , do n't bother looking out your window .

Because what you see does n't really matter .
