China seizes melamine-tainted feed - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- Still reeling from news of melamine-tainted eggs and dairy , China launched a massive inspection into animal feed manufacturers -- seizing more than 3,500 tons of tainted feed , state-run media reported Sunday .

The Agriculture Ministry deployed 369,300 agricultural experts and law enforcement personnel to inspect 250,400 animal feed producers and farms , the Xinhua news agency reported .

Wang Zhicai , the ministry 's director of husbandry and livestock , said the inspectors confiscated and destroyed 3,682 tons of melamine-tainted feed , shut down 238 feed producers and investigated 278 other companies and farms suspected of illegal activity , Xinhua reported .

Some 22,700 batches of animal feed were checked for melamine and nearly 98 percent met government standards , Xinhua reported , citing the Agriculture Ministry .

It remains unclear how much tainted feed has entered the food chain .

In the aftermath of the melamine-tainted milk scandal , 'there has been a national focus on the discovery of melamine in animal feed and its component ingredients , and there have been particular movements to achieve quality and safety in animal feed, ' Wang said , according to Xinhua .

Wang said the ministry issued a rule in June 2007 that banned the use of melamine in feed production , Xinhua reported .

However , the state-run Nanfang Daily published an investigative story last week , saying that adding melamine into animal feed has become an 'open secret. '

The report said adding melamine into feed started in the aquatic farming industry five years ago , as a way of faking higher protein levels .
It then spread into other agro-industries , including poultry .

Two years ago , reports revealed pet food exported from China to the United States was spiked with melamine and had sickened and killed dogs .

Several weeks ago , the food scandal spread to milk , biscuits and candies .
Then , it was tainted eggs .
So far , no illnesses or deaths have been linked to eggs .

Tests in Hong Kong in October showed eggs exported by a Chinese company are contaminated with excessive levels of melamine .
In recent days , three other brands of eggs have also been found to contain the chemical .

Ingesting melamine in large doses over an extended period of time could cause kidney stones and other illnesses , though small amounts pose no such danger , agriculture and health experts say .
