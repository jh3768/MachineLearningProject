Peacekeepers' fury over Somalia killing - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- The African Union responded angrily and defiantly to the killing of at least 11 Burundian soldiers in an apparent suicide bomb attack Sunday in Somalia 's capital , Mogadishu .

The 11 soldiers were on a peacekeeping mission for the African Union .
The attack also seriously injured 15 people .

A spokesman for al-Shabab , a radical Islamist militia with ties to al Qaeda , claimed responsibility for the attack , saying at a news conference that it had been carried out by two 'martyrs. '

The attackers 'have no care for Somalia , and their sole aim is to destroy and bring about more violence to the country, ' El-Ghassim Wane , an African Union spokesman , said from the organization 's headquarters in Addis Ababa , Ethiopia .

' In any event , it wo n't affect our determination to do whatever we can to support Somalia, ' the African Union said in a statement .

There is a 3,400-strong African Union peacekeeping force in Somalia , made up entirely of Burundian and Ugandan troops .
The AU awaits additional soldiers from member countries , with the force expected to reach about 8,000 soldiers .

The attack was the deadliest yet for peacekeeping soldiers in the battle-torn city of Mogadishu .

In early February , mortars were fired at the presidential palace hours after newly elected Somalian President Sheikh Sharif Sheekh Ahmed arrived in the country 's capital .
Ahmed was voted in by parliament .

Somalia 's U.N.-backed transitional government is still coming together .
On Sunday evening , the newly formed Cabinet met for the first time , in Djibouti , according to the Shabelle Media Network .

Militias have controlled most of Somalia for nearly two decades .

Ethiopian troops invaded the country at its request in December 2006 .
The Ethiopian invasion ousted the Islamic Courts Union , an Islamic movement that had claimed control of Mogadishu earlier that year .

Ethiopia 's invasion had the blessing of the United States , which accused the Islamic Courts Union of harboring fugitives from al Qaeda .
But various Islamist groups -- including al-Shabab , which the United States has designated a terror organization -- rejected the presence of Ethiopian forces and mounted an insurgent campaign against the Ethiopians and the transitional government .
