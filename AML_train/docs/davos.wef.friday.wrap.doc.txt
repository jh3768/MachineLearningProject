Turkish PM cheered after Davos walkout - CNN.com
DAVOS , Switzerland ( CNN ) -- Thousands of people turned out to greet Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on his return home from Davos Friday , a day after he stormed off stage following a heated exchange with Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres over Israel 's military campaign in Gaza .

The pair exchanged angry words during the debate but Peres told CNN on Friday the two leaders had spoken on the phone to clear the air .

In a press conference earlier , Erdogan said his words were directed at the Israeli government , not the Israeli people .

' I heard his press conference and he said it was nothing against me , nothing against Israel .
So I called him up and said yes it 's nothing against you , nothing against Turkey , we consider you as a friend, ' Peres said .

But Peres said it had been his duty to 'answer unfounded accusations ' and denied either side had apologized to the other .

' I did n't take it personally , I did n't go for a personal fight .
I answered unfounded accusations , it was my duty , and they did n't change my mind .
I have relations with Turkey , relations with the prime minister , relations with the president and that 's it. '

Erdogan returned home to a hero 's welcome following his scene-grabbing moment in Davos .
Thousands of people lined up at Ataturk Airport in Istanbul , cheering and waving signs .
A large banner read , 'You Will Never Walk Alone ' and other , smaller signs bore phrases including 'Davos Conqueror. '

People were also seen waving Turkish and Palestinian flags and throwing flowers on the road leading to Erdogan 's home .
Despite the glowing response at the airport , there has been some criticism in Turkish media of Erdogan 's exchange with the Israeli president .

CNN Turk 's Deniz Bayramoglu said the issue was still 'hot ' with Erdogan 's secularist political opponents speaking out against the prime minister .

' They also say that Israel 's behavior in Gaza is unacceptable but they are very critical of Prime Minister Erdogan 's behavior, ' Bayramoglu said .

' Some are saying they are really proud of Prime Minister Erdogan and some are saying it is a diplomatic scandal. '

Erdogan had been angered after Peres said that Israel is committed to peace and blamed Hamas for the fighting in Gaza , where Israel staged a three-week military operation that ended earlier this month .

When Erdogan began responding , a moderator cut him off , saying the debate had run over its allotted time .
Erdogan patted the moderator on the arm until he was granted one more minute to respond .

' I know the reason behind raising your voice is because of the guilty psychology, ' he said to Peres .
' My voice will not be that loud , you must know that. '

' When it comes to killing -- you know killing very well .
I know how you hit , kill children on the beaches. '

He then left the stage , complaining that Peres was receiving preferential treatment .

' From now on , Davos is finished for me, ' Erdogan said .
' I will not come back .
You wo n't let people talk .
You gave him 25 minutes , but you gave me 12 minutes .
This is not right. '

Erdogan had described the military campaign against Hamas fighters in Gaza as 'barbaric ' and accused Israel of using excessive force .

Peres had said Hamas was responsible for the 'tragedy, ' accusing the Islamist militants of creating a 'dangerous dictatorship. '

' Israel left Gaza completely -- no occupation, ' Peres said .
' I want to understand why they throw rockets at us .
