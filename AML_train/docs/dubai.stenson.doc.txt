Stenson leads fog-hit Dubai Desert Classic - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- Sweden 's Henrik Stenson heads the Dubai Desert Classic leaderboard at the end of a second day heavily-disrupted by fog .

Dubai resident Stenson shot a bogey-free seven-under 65 to lead on 11-under 133 .

Australian Richard Green , like Stenson a previous Dubai winner , is one shot behind , but with just over half the field to complete their second rounds the position could change on Saturday when play resumes .

Green shot a brilliant nine-under 63 with world number two Sergio Garcia sitting two further shots back on eight under after a 66 from the Spaniard .

Just over six hours of play were lost to the conditions at the Emirates Golf Club , with 24 players unable to even start their second rounds .

' It was a grinding day, ' Qatar Masters runner-up Stenson told Press Association .

' But when I hit bad shots I recovered well and made some good birdies on the good shots so it was a very well-scored round. '

First-round leader , Northern Ireland teenager Rory McIlroy , was a late starter but dropped back to seven-under alongside India 's Jeev Milkha Singh after a bogey during his three holes possible .

In-form South African Louis Oosthuizen , European number one Robert Karlsson , Spain 's Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano and Frenchman Gregory Havret are a shot further back on six-under after playing a handful of holes .

Tournament officials are hoping for better conditions on Saturday which would allow the third-round leaders to complete nine holes before returning on Sunday morning ahead of their final rounds .

But should fog again delay the start , officials will have to decide whether to extend the tournament until Monday or decide to cut the event to 54 holes .

The Desert Classic is the final tournament of a lucrative three-event 'Gulf Swing ' , attracting a strong field as the Race to Dubai hots up .
