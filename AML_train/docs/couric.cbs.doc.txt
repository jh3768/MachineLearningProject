Couric, CBS say she isn't leaving soon - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- CBS News and 'CBS Evening News ' anchor Katie Couric are downplaying a Wall Street Journal report that Couric plans to leave the network long before her contract expires in 2011 .

Couric 's contract with CBS began with much fanfare in 2006 , but for most of that time the network 's evening newscast has continued to trail rivals ABC and NBC by wide margins .

In a pair of statements , neither the network nor Couric flatly denied the report , but both downplayed any pending split .

' We are very proud of the 'CBS Evening News, ' particularly our political coverage , and we have no plans for any changes regarding Katie or the broadcast, ' the network said in a written statement .

In a separate statement , Couric said she is 'working hard and having fun ' on the broadcast .

' My colleagues continue to impress me with their commitment to the newscast , and I am very proud of the show we put on every day, ' she said .

The Wall Street Journal article , published Wednesday , quoted unnamed 'CBS news executives ' and 'people close to Katie Couric ' saying she would leave possibly soon after next year 's presidential inauguration .

The newspaper also carried the statements from CBS and Couric .
