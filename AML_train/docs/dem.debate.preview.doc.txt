Democrats talk up change in last debate before Iowa caucuses - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- Sen. Hillary Clinton on Thursday tried to portray herself as the candidate most able to bring about change at the Democratic presidential hopefuls ' final debate before next month 's Iowa caucuses .

' Everyone wants change .
Well , everybody on this stage has an idea about how to get change, ' Clinton said .

' Some believe you get change by demanding it .
Some believe you get it by hoping for it .
I believe you get it by working hard for change. '

Thursday 's debate , sponsored by The Des Moines Register and Iowa Public Television , comes as recent polls show Clinton losing her lead nationally weeks before Iowa 's January 3 caucuses .

Sen. Chris Dodd of Connecticut said the first thing he 'd try to change is the 'discourse , the shrillness of the discussion in this country. '

He said the issues raised at the debate depend on having a president who can heal the country 's divisions .

' We care about the same things .
We want the same things .
We 've got leadership that appeals to the divisions , not the unity we all feel as Americans, ' he said .

The Democrats kicked off the last debate before the caucuses by weighing in on the country 's financial situation .

When asked if it would be a priority to balance the federal budget every year , Sen. Barack Obama said , 'We are not going to be able to dig ourselves out of that hole in one or two years .

' If we can get on a path of sustained growth , if we can end the war in Iraq , end some of the special interest loopholes and earmarks that have been clogging up the system , I think we can return to a path of a balanced budget, ' the senator from Illinois said .

New Mexico Gov .
Bill Richardson said he would push for line-item veto authority to balance the budget as president .

' Balancing the budget should be viewed as an opportunity to have economic growth in this country, ' he said .

Asked about when tax increases are necessary and appropriate , Clinton said the people of Iowa 'feel as though they 're standing on a trapdoor. '

' They are one pink slip , one missed mortgage payment , one medical diagnosis away from falling through, ' she said .

Clinton said she wants to restore the tax rates of the '90s .

' That means raising taxes on corporations and wealthy individuals .
I want to keep the middle-class tax cuts, ' she said .

Clinton also said the North American Free Trade Agreement should be changed .

' I want to be a president who focuses on smart , pro-American trade, ' she said .
' I 'm going to go to the international community and get the kind of enforceable agreements and standards on labor and environment that we have been seeking as Democrats. '

Given 30 seconds to make a statement , former Sen. John Edwards said jobs , the middle class , health care and the environment are at risk because of 'corporate power and corporate greed in Washington. '

In his 30-second statement , Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware said ending the war in Iraq would be one his priorities .

' Folks talk about this election being about experience or change .
It 's really about action and pragmatic solutions, ' he said .
' Leadership is also about knowing who you are , what you believe , and what your priorities are , and what you 'll do .
In my case , I 'll start by ending that war in Iraq. '

Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Ohio and former Sen. Mike Gravel , who had both participated in earlier debates , were not invited to Thursday 's event because they did not meet standards established by the organizers , which include having a campaign office in the Hawkeye State

With her 20-point lead in New Hampshire gone and her national edge deteriorating , Clinton now faces a wide-open race .

Many political observers saw Clinton as the 'inevitable ' Democratic presidential nominee a few months ago , but Obama has steadily chipped away at her lead in recent months .

In a CNN/WMUR poll conducted by the University of New Hampshire and released Wednesday , Clinton and Obama are in a statistical dead heat in New Hampshire , which will hold the nation 's first primary January 8 .
Clinton 's 1-point lead over Obama , 31 percent to 30 percent , is within the poll 's margin of error of 5 percentage points .
Edwards came in third at 16 percent .

Recent polls also show the race tightening nationally .
When the Democrats debated last in Las Vegas , Nevada , in November , Clinton led Obama 44 percent to 25 percent , according to a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll. Now , a CNN/Opinion Research poll shows Clinton with a narrower lead nationally over Obama , 40 percent to 30 percent .
