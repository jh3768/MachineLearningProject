Obama wants temporary aid for automakers - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- President-elect Barack Obama said Friday that he hopes there still will be a way to provide temporary assistance to keep the troubled U.S. automakers afloat .

' I am disappointed that the Senate could not reach agreement on a short-term plan for the auto industry, ' Obama said in a statement following Thursday night 's defeat of a $ 14 billion bailout proposal .

' The revival of our economy as a whole should not be a partisan issue .
So I commend those in Congress as well as the administration who tried valiantly to forge a compromise .
My hope is that the administration and the Congress will still find a way to give the industry the temporary assistance it needs while demanding the long-term restructuring that is absolutely required. '

Obama also said he shared in the frustration about 'decades of mismanagement ' in the auto industry that contributed to the crisis .

The White House said earlier Friday that it will consider using funds from the original $ 700 billion Wall Street bailout if necessary to keep the automakers from failing .

The White House originally opposed using any of the $ 700 billion to help the auto industry , but it also has said the Big Three must get some financial assistance soon .

Those funds were intended for the financial services industry and banking system to shore up the financial infrastructure of the economy .

The Bush administration 's announcement came after a deal for $ 14 billion in federal loans for the automobile industry died on a procedural vote on the Senate floor late Thursday .

' It is disappointing that while appropriate and effective legislation to assist and restructure troubled automakers received majority support in both houses , Congress nevertheless failed to pass final legislation, ' said White Press secretary Dana Perino .

' Under normal economic conditions we would prefer that markets determine the ultimate fate of private firms .
However , given the current weakened state of the U.S. economy , we will consider other options if necessary -- including use of the TARP program -- to prevent a collapse of troubled automakers, ' she said , referring to the Troubled Assets Relief Program , or Wall Street bailout .

Perino said the collapse of the automobile industry would have a severe impact on the economy , and 'it would be irresponsible to further weaken and destabilize our economy at this time. '

While the federal government may need to step in , she added , the auto companies and their unions also must be prepared to make concessions .

The Senate voted 52-35 to bring the measure for a vote -- short of the 60 votes needed to advance the legislation .
Following this crushing defeat for the Big Three , Senate Democrats issued dire warnings , while Republican senators put the blame on the automobile companies .

There are fears General Motors Corp. and Chrysler might not last a month without some sort of cash infusion .
Ford Motor Co. has more cash on hand , but problems in the supplier base could disrupt production .

Republicans said the United Auto Workers were not willing to go along with a proposal led by GOP Sen. Bob Corker to have Big Three Union workers get the same pay as U.S. employees of foreign automakers .

' We had an arrangement last night that we were just six minutes away from a full agreement that would have really caused these companies to be able to go in the future very healthily, ' Corker said Friday on CNN 's 'American Morning. '

' It came down to one thing -- and that was just getting the UAW to agree to a date certain that they would be competitive. '

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Kentucky , said while no one wants to see the Big Three go down , 'very few of us had anything to do with the dilemma that they 've created for themselves. '

Before the defeat , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D-Nevada , said lawmakers knew the vote was going to fail and made clear he knew what the consequences would be .

' Everyone should understand this vote is over tonight .
I do n't think we 're going to get 60 votes .
It 's over with .
I dread , Mr. President , I dread looking at Wall Street tomorrow .
It 's not going to be a pleasant sight, ' he said Thursday night .

Some analysts expressed surprise that the Republicans broke with the White House .
The White House was instrumental in hammering out the plan that sped through the House of Representatives this week .

' I think the White House has no influence over anyone at this point .
And that 's the first lesson, ' said Jeffrey Toobin , CNN 's senior legal analyst .

' The second point is , I do n't understand the White House 's strategy .
Because on the one hand they say , 'If you vote this down , it 's a total calamity .
But if you vote this down , we 're going to use the $ 700 billion .
So do n't worry about it that much. '

' That does n't seem like a very effective way to negotiate .
And so this turned into a cost-free way for the Republicans to say we do n't like this deal, ' he said .
