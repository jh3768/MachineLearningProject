Al Qaeda No. 2 releases second message of 2009 - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- Al Qaeda 's second-in-command , Ayman al-Zawahiri , released a new audio message Tuesday , condemning Israel and calling for renewed attacks .

The message shows a grouping of photographs that include an old photo of al-Zawahiri , three dead children and a collage of world leaders : French President Nicolas Sarkozy , Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas , King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak .

Speaking critically of the recent conflict in Gaza , al-Zawahiri blamed 'western collaboration ' in supporting Israel and blamed Israel 's allies for not distinguishing 'the killer from the victim. '

He also criticized U.S. President Obama for not mentioning Gaza during his inaugural address .

Al-Zawahiri 's references to the Obama inaugural speech and the Israeli pullout from Gaza suggest that the message was recorded on or after January 20 .

CNN can not authenticate the message , but CNN analysts who listened to the recording say the voice is consistent with his intonation and accent .

This is the second message from al-Zawahiri in 2009 .

Another was released January 6 , calling the fighting between Israel and Palestinians then under way in Gaza a 'massacre. '

Obama 's transition team did not directly respond to the message .
Ahead of its release , Obama said he was 'deeply concerned ' about the loss of life in both Gaza and Israel , and promised to make the issue a top priority in his administration .
