Will energy savings jump-start the economy?  - CNN.com
NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- It looks like America may be getting a whole lot more energy-efficient as part of any new stimulus package .

But how exactly will that happen ?
While new light bulbs , insulation and air conditioners may play well with homeowners , will such a plan actually put enough people to work to jump-start the economy ?

The energy-saving plan is expected as part of a stimulus package from lawmakers set for early January that could top $ 800 billion and include everything from tax breaks to road repairs .

Conservation is thought to be the first big energy-component of U.S. President-elect Barack Obama 's long-term energy plan , for a couple of reasons .

First , it can be done relatively quickly using existing state and regional agencies .

Conservation is also essential if the country is to switch to cleaner and more renewable forms of electricity , since it ca n't currently provide the sheer megawatts that fossil fuel or nuclear power can produce .

If a major conservation initiative is included in the stimulus package , it might look something like a plan being pushed by the electric utility industry and a handful of environmental groups -- a coalition called the Alliance to Save Energy .

What 's in store ?

Under such a plan , the government would commit just over $ 30 billion towards making the nation energy efficient .
The money would be spent as follows :

-- $ 3 billion for home energy retrofits , which could include rebate checks for people who buy energy-efficient appliances like air conditioners and refrigerators .

-- $ 3 billion for energy retrofits at public buildings , which may include hiring people to conduct energy audits and install so-called 'smart-meters ' that more efficiently allocate power .

-- $ 3 billion to promote energy efficiency in commercial buildings , largely in the form of tax breaks for developers who build them .

-- $ 3 billion for efficiency projects at schools .

-- $ 3.5 billion to expand current state energy efficiency programs .

-- $ 5 billion more for states that pass stricter building efficiency standards and restructure their utility conservation incentives .

-- $ 6 billion for local governments to make power plants and transportation networks more efficient .

-- $ 4 billion for things that include construction of a better electric grid , efficiency at military institutions , workforce training , additional smart meters , and an expansion of the weatherization program to better insulate homes .

In the interest of time , no new agencies are planned .
Instead , the money would likely be administered by existing agencies , be they state , federal or regional , or utilities with strong conservation departments .

But will it work ?

All told , the program might drop the country 's energy consumption by half a percent each year for 20 years .
While that does n't sound like much , with the U.S. spending over $ 1 trillion on energy each year , the savings could top $ 5 billion a year , or over $ 100 billion .

' An economic recovery bill that includes significant investments in energy efficiency will not only create jobs immediately , but also and more importantly will bring American ingenuity and its 'can-do ' spirit to a new , clean and sustainable energy future, ' Alliance to Save Energy President Kateri Callahan said in a statement announcing the program last week .

Fine , but is it stimulating ?

There 's little doubt energy efficiency is something the country should invest in , and there 's little doubt it will save energy .

But should we borrow money for it and include it in a stimulus bill , a bill that 's designed to create jobs and get the economy back on track ?

Plenty of people say yes .

The Alliance estimates its plan will directly create 190,000 jobs in short order .

The Associated General Contractors of America backs the plan , saying every $ 1 billion dollars spent on infrastructure - energy efficiency included - nearly 30,000 jobs are created .

' Clearly , it will put construction workers back to work and put money in the economy, ' said Brian Turmail , a spokesman for the contractors ' association .
' This is a tremendous opportunity. '

Money well spent ?
Not everyone thinks so

But others see it as little more than a tremendous opportunity for waste .

' How on earth can this thing be administered without generating a lot of waste, ' said Rudolph Penner , a senior fellow at the Urban Institute , a research group .

Beyond the potential for waste , critics generally argue that it takes too long for the projects to start up to have the desired effect , and that the economics simply do n't make sense .

Once the projects get going , they also say the projects are hard to stop and can then contribute to inflation , not to mention a ballooning debt once the economy recovers .

On the energy part specifically , Penner said it would be hard to calculate who was conserving because of the incentive , and who would normally have spent money to conserve anyway .

' Some people would chose to insulate their homes anyway, ' he said .
' For them , this would just be a windfall. '
