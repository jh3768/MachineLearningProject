Argentina farm strike turns violent - CNN.com
BUENOS AIRES , Argentina ( CNN ) -- A three-month standoff between the Argentine government and farmers over export taxes turned violent Saturday .

Local reports said there were several injuries and 18 arrests , including Alfredo De Angeli , a farm union leader who has been one of the most outspoken critics of President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner 's export tax .

Military police scuffled with farmers as they tried to remove them from a road that protesters had blocked with their trucks .

Protesters responded by throwing rocks at police and burning large truck tires in the road .
Thick clouds of black smoke could be seen for miles .

Scenes of baton-wielding police in riot gear carrying struggling protesters away in trucks were broadcast live around the country .

The clashes took place in the farming community of Gualeguaychu , a stronghold for the protesters , about 124 miles ( 200 kilometers ) north of Buenos Aires .

' It 's embarrassing and shameful what this government is doing to us, ' one protester said .
' They need to sit down again with us so we can have dialogue , not violence. '

It was the worst day of violence in the 95-day conflict , which started in March over a new 44 percent commodities tax that farmers say unfairly cuts their profits at a time of record gains .

Argentina is the world 's second-largest corn exporter and third-largest soy bean supplier .

The farming sector is widely credited with helping the country rebound from a devastating economic crisis in 2001 .

Kirchner says the new tax plan will cut inflation and increase domestic supplies to feed Argentina 's poor .

Farmers have sporadically cut off transportation routes in the country over the past three months in an effort to hit the government 's coffers .
In those cases , food that normally ships to Europe and Asia has not made it to port , and hundreds of thousands of gallons of spoiled milk have been dumped on rural routes .

Despite the occasional chaos , Argentina 's middle class has rallied behind the farmers and voiced their displeasure with the government .

Thousands took to the streets in Buenos Aires on Saturday to bang pots and pans in support of the striking farmers .
They also cut off traffic at busy city intersections , waving Argentine flags , singing the national anthem and asking for dialogue between the government and farmers .

Kirchner 's popularity has dropped to just 26 percent because of the farming stalemate , which has been the toughest challenge yet to her six-month presidency .

In addition to causing internal conflict , the Argentine farm strike has also driven up global prices for commodities like soy beans , wheat and corn .
