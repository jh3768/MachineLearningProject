Jefferson slept here - CNN.com
( Budget Travel Online ) -- The official mascot of the University of Virginia is the musketeer-like Cavalier , but unofficially it 's the wahoo , a fish that , according to student legend , can drink twice its weight in a day .
That 's probably not what Thomas Jefferson had in mind when he designed U.Va .
' s elegant neoclassical brick buildings and colonnades .

Having all but completed work on Monticello , his home five miles south of the campus , he spent the last years of his life building the university , which includes the Rotunda , a half-scale version of the Pantheon in Rome .
Jefferson died less than 18 months after the first classes were held in March 1825 .

But he 'd be pleased that nearly 200 years later , the university is still the heart of Charlottesville .
In a town of 45,000 , the 20,000-strong student population is a visible presence , especially along the historic brick-paved pedestrian mall a mile and a half east of campus .
Most of the restaurants have outdoor tables , which fill up quickly on Saturday afternoons .
A number of the mall 's storefronts are filled with books ( New Dominion Bookshop is the best of the bunch ) .

Thanks to Charlottesville 's most famous musical export , The Dave Matthews Band , the town also has big-city-quality nightlife .
While some band members still have homes in the area -- as do Sissy Spacek and John Grisham -- it 's DMB 's manager , Coran Capshaw , who has made the biggest impact in recent years .
He has opened eight restaurants -- and counting .
' You can definitely feel his presence, ' says Che Stratos , a Charlottesville native .
' Eric Clapton played here .
That never would have happened before. '

Capshaw 's popular Blue Light Grill &amp ; Raw Bar is where the young and beautiful go to sip martinis , sitting in leather banquettes in the window that faces the mall .
The warm , red-and-orange interior befits the Asian-influenced menu .
Grilled Hawaiian wahoo is , of course , a favorite .

In the Belmont neighborhood , Capshaw turned what was once a gas station into the industrial-modern Mas , a tapas bar open till 2 a.m. that serves mostly organic small plates , such as wild mushrooms sauteed with garlic , herbs , Mahon cheese and butter .

At Starr Hill , you can try the ale-infused dishes ( 'beeramisu ' and stout-marinated steak ) in the dining room and then head upstairs to listen to live music .
Bigger acts like Wilco , James Brown and Willie Nelson have played at the outdoor Charlottesville Pavilion , which Capshaw helped build at the east end of the mall .
On Friday evenings in summer , there are free concerts under the tent .

Long before he made the big time , Dave Matthews used to bartend at Miller 's Restaurant , a converted 90-year-old drugstore that still has the original pharmacy drawers and tin ceiling .
Many fans have made a pilgrimage there , but few realize ( or perhaps even care ) that Matthews never actually played on the small stage .
' Matthews has n't been back for years, ' says one of the bartenders , 'because this is where people come to look for him. '

Students tend to congregate at The Corner , an area on University Avenue right across from the campus .
At the Buddhist Biker Bar &amp ; Grill , in a Federal-style brick building nearby , they spill out onto the wraparound patio and lawn with glasses of beer in hand .
Thomas Jefferson surely would n't mind : He used to brew his own over at Monticello .
