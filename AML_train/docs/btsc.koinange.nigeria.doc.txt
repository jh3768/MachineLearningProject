Koinange: Big guns, big oil collide in Nigeria - CNN.com
WARRI , Nigeria ( CNN ) -- Splashing across the murky waters of southern Nigeria in a speedboat , I suddenly found myself in one of the scariest positions of my journalistic career : masked militants firing machine guns at me and my crew .

We hit the deck , shouting , 'We are press !
We are press !
' Eventually , the bullets stopped flying and the gunmen approached our boat , demanding to know who we were .

As I stared down the barrels of some very big guns , being held by angry young men , I began to have doubts about our trip here .

The waters are so dangerous in these parts that the Nigerian navy does n't even dare patrol the region .
In a word , it 's a no-go zone for outsiders .

' How many times do you people come here with your cameras and nothing is done ?
We do n't want you guys to come here again, ' one of the gunmen shouted .

But we were n't about to leave so easily .

I had been given permission to come to the region from the militants themselves to find out what is happening in the Niger Delta , where the well-armed militants have been fighting Nigeria 's beleaguered armed forces over oil .

These guys in their intimidating black outfits and matching black ski masks looked like any army 's worst nightmare .
And that 's exactly what they 've become : Nigeria 's worst nightmare .

They call themselves the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta , or MEND .
They insist what they 're trying to do is mend what they say is the unequal distribution from the profits Nigeria gets from its oil bonanza .

Nigeria is Africa 's largest oil producer .
In 2005 , it was the world 's sixth largest exporter of oil , but the conflict there has cut distribution by an estimated 500,000 barrels per day , the U.S. Department of Energy said in November .

Very little of the profits makes it back to Nigeria , and even less makes it down to the mangrove swamps of the Niger Delta .

As a result , MEND in recent months has escalated its struggle , kidnapping expatriate oil workers at an alarming rate ( more than 30 in the last month alone ) , indiscriminately killing Nigerian military forces , and carrying out attacks on oil installations in the region that cut the flow of oil dramatically .

Now , as guns pointed at me , I explained we had been given permission for them to take us to their leader .
They laughed me off , saying their leader does n't talk to anyone , especially journalists .

But they agreed to take us to one of their hideouts and show us something no Western journalist had seen : dozens of MEND militants in black dancing and chanting themselves into a trance .
Some pointed their guns menacingly at us ; others simply tried to intimidate us .

It was MEND military might for the whole world to see .
And they told me this is just a fraction of their forces .
They claimed to have more than 200,000 troops spread across an area the size of Texas .

As the militants danced , they displayed their latest hostages : 24 Filipino sailors captured on January 20 as their cargo ship tried to take turn into the port of Warri .

It is the largest number of foreign hostages ever captured here at a single time .
The Filipinos seemed dazed and confused , their nerves wearing thin as they struggled to come to terms with a fight they said they have no clue about .

The militants fired into the air .
The hostages flinched .
I thought there was going to be an execution in front of us -- and I 'm sure the hostages thought the same thing .

After about an hour , the militants agreed to take me to their leader .
They said that due to his superstitions , we could only interview him out in the middle of the creeks and they took us back out into the water .

A short while later , he appeared , accompanied by a small army of heavily armed bodyguards .

He described himself as 'Major General Tamuno, ' the field commander of MEND .
He spoke softly through the slits of his black ski mask .

' MEND is a struggle for the liberation of the Niger Delta , the most devastated and the most threatened region in the world, ' he said .

' Our fight is against everybody -- every institution that do n't want the people of the Niger Delta to have their fair share. '

I learned this militant leader has a degree in political science from a local university , but he could n't find work after college .
Many of his men are the same -- educated and frustrated .

He told me foreigners working in Nigeria 's oil sector should get out now .

' We will take lives , we will destroy lives , we will crumble the economy, ' he said bluntly .

And with that , the interview was suddenly over .

We were escorted back out into open waters by a convoy of speedboats .
As we were about to leave , one of the masked gunmen reissued his group 's threats .

' If they do n't listen , well , maybe Nigeria will go into pieces .
We do n't know how many pieces it will go into , but the federal government will not be in peace unless they listen to us, ' he said .

And just like that , they were off -- speedboats spluttering in the water , gunfire echoing into the crisp afternoon air and , before we 'd even put down our gear , the militants were gone .

After CNN ran this report Frank Nweke Jr. , the Nigerian Minister of Information and Communications , blasted the piece by saying it 'utterly disregards the most elementary principle of journalism because no government official was interviewed. '

He said it 'sends the wrong signals to the international community about the state of affairs in the country , create unnecessary panic , foster the feeling of insecurity , advance an out-dated thesis of neglect of the Niger Delta and portray Nigeria as a country in perpetual crises .
It also glorifies criminality and undermines global efforts at eliminating terrorism. '

CNN responded by saying , 'We can tell you that CNN did make a considerable effort to obtain comment on the story from both the Nigerian navy and the Nigerian president 's office .
No one from the government was made available to CNN. '
