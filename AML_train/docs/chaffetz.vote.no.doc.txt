WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Stimulus .
Stimulus. Stimulus .
This story does n't just dominate the headlines -- it dominates the phone lines .

The vast majority of calls , e-mails and letters to my office have been questions about the stimulus .

This one policy proposal could have a bigger impact on our future than any other piece of legislation we pass this term .
There 's a lot at stake .

While the country needs and deserves government action to revive the economy , I am afraid the final bill fell far short of the goal .
If we got this wrong , we may find that the medicine is worse than the disease .
After all , we do n't have a trillion dollars in a bank account somewhere .
Whether we borrow money or print it , there is a cost .
And the cost is not small .

People from around the country and in my district are worried about the long-term impact of this bill .
They bombarded my office with pleas to oppose it .
I voted 'no ' on the first round of votes and on the final bill .
This bill will grow government , not our economy .

The Democrats claimed they have been working with Republicans on the stimulus .
Hogwash. For a bill of this size , the lack of debate , inclusion , discussion , documentation and transparency was frightening .

Each hour there was a new story about more pork and government intervention .
One morning the hot topic was a picture of Hillary Clinton riding in a 'green ' golf cart and the revelation that the stimulus gives $ 300 million to fund these golf carts .

The president made a claim that some in Congress advocate doing nothing .
I am not aware of anyone who took that position .
Republicans proposed alternatives .
We want to stimulate spending in the private sector and allow everyone to thrive , especially small- and medium-sized businesses .

Republican members have been regularly cycling through floor speeches and communications back home to let people know our position .
It seems to be working .
While the president 's personal approval numbers are strong , most Utahns seem to agree that this bill spends too much and goes too far .
The American public deserves better .

While the stimulus debate has dominated the headlines , it 's not the only thing happening in Washington .
We have started working on our committee assignments .

I am on three committees ( Judiciary , Oversight and Government Reform , and Natural Resources ) and six subcommittees .
Leadership has shown a lot of faith in me by appointing me ranking member on Oversight and Government Reform 's Subcommittee on Federal Workforce , Postal Service , and the District of Columbia .

I did n't expect such an honor as a freshman .

If you ever watch committee hearings , you may wonder why so many committee members do n't seem to show up .
I 'm sure it does n't look good on television .
But the reality is that most of us have multiple hearings and meetings happening at the same time .
You can only be in one place at a time , so we often have to choose one meeting over another .

I had to choose between a Natural Resources hearing and an Oversight and Government Reform Committee meeting .
I first went to Oversight and then an hour later to Natural Resources .

In Natural Resources , we had Ted Danson ( yes , of 'Cheers ' and 'Becker ' fame ) and Philippe Cousteau ( Jacques Cousteau 's grandson ) address the full committee regarding drilling policy on the Outer Continental Shelf .

I sent a tweet on Twitter that said , 'Ted Danson testifying before Natural Resources on offshore drilling .
I plan to share some acting tips with him .
We both win .
' We had a good banter back and forth .
He is passionate on this issue , but so am I ( I 'm in favor of drilling ) .
It was a good , healthy dialogue even though we often did not agree .

As I write this it is late on a Wednesday , I find myself thinking about my family .
The work here is exciting , rewarding and the issues are complex , but I do miss my wife and children .

Not being home to see them each night is a sacrifice .
They give me the driving energy to do what I do , but being away is hard .
I love them and I miss hugging them and hearing about their day -- in person !

But our country is in financial crisis .
Our response to that crisis may have an impact for generations to come .
The stakes are high .
Win or lose , the American people deserve to know that we fought to make their voices heard .
That 's what I came here to do .
