Man deposits millions, one tattered bill at a time - CNN.com
WASHINGTON ( AP ) -- The businessman arrived at the Treasury Department carrying a suitcase stuffed with about $ 5.2 million in petrified , nearly unrecognizable bills .
He asked to swap it for a cashier 's check .

Money like this normally arrives after a bank burns or a vault floods .
It does n't just show up at the visitor 's entrance on a Tuesday morning .

But Franz Felhaber 's banking habits had stopped making sense to the government long ago .

For years , authorities say , he and his family have popped in and out of U.S. banks , looking to change about $ 20 million in decaying $ 100 bills for clean cash , offering ever-changing stories :

& # 8226 ; It was an inheritance .
& # 8226 ; Somebody dug up a tree and there it was .
& # 8226 ; It was found in a suitcase buried in an alfalfa field & # 8226 ; A relative found a treasure map .

That buried treasure stands to make someone rich .
It could also send someone to jail .

Felhaber 's is a customs broker .
His company , F.C. Felhaber &amp ; Co. , navigates the customs bureaucracy in El Paso , Texas , where tens of billions of dollars in Mexican goods enter each year .

Discrete deposits

If discretion were the goal , Felhaber went about it all wrong .
Rather than making one exchange at the Treasury , Felhaber allegedly began trying to exchange smaller amounts at El Paso-area banks , raising suspicion every time .

In 2005 , authorities say he arranged a $ 120,000 exchange at the Federal Reserve Bank in El Paso , with the money being wired to an account belonging to his uncle , Jose Carrillo-Valles .

Banks normally refer such requests to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing , an arm of the Treasury .
The $ 120,000 exchange was an exception .
Investigators say Felhaber was n't so lucky elsewhere .

Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials say he unsuccessfully tried to get a Bank of America armored truck dispatched to the Mexican border to retrieve the money .
Weeks later , they say he gave a fake name at two banks while inquiring about exchanging millions .

Once , the explanation was that he discovered the money while excavating a tree in Chihuahua , Mexico .
Another time , the story was that it had been buried in an alfalfa field , investigators say .

Felhaber denies nearly all of this , including giving a fake name .
But he is tough to pin down on details .
At times he acknowledges helping exchange a $ 20 million inheritance .
Minutes later , he contradicts himself and says there 's nowhere near that much .
And he has no idea where the money came from .

It 's unclear what first caught investigators ' attention .
Most of the thousands of mutilated money exchanges each year are routine .
Natural disasters create lots of inquiries .
Children of the Depression have discovered their attic savings shredded by rodents .
Greeting cards stuffed with money are accidentally shredded .

But Leonard R. Olijar , the chief financial officer of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing , said there are warning signs that will trigger investigations .
A series of small exchanges , for instance .
Or money coming from abroad .

ICE agents questioned Felhaber in October 2005 .
According to a government summary of that interview , Felhaber said he believed the money came from a Mexican land deal .
It was buried in a coffin , he said , until Francisco Javier Ramos Saenz-Pardo -- who brought him the money in the first place -- discovered a treasure map .

He now says he was mistaken in his interviews with investigators .

Unanswered questions

' They take you to your word like you 're supposed to remember every single thing every single time, ' he said .

Maybe it was the visit from federal agents or perhaps someone realized the bank visits were n't working .
But the strategy apparently changed .

In January 2006 , the Bureau of Engraving and Printing received a package containing about $ 136,000 from Jose Carrillo-Valles , Felhaber 's uncle .
A letter explained the money had been stored in a basement for 22 years .

There was no evidence of a crime , just unanswered questions .
So the Treasury mailed a check , which Carrillo-Valles deposited .
Yet when authorities followed the money , he and his wife denied knowing about it , according to a government affidavit .

And the $ 120,000 wired to Carrillo-Valles ' account a year earlier from the Federal Reserve ?
The couple said it was an inheritance .

Authorities do n't believe that .
They traced a wire transfer from Carrillo-Valles ' account to someone named Saenz-Pardo , suggesting that Carrillo-Valles was an intermediary who took a cut of the money and sent the rest to Mexico .

Twice , reporters called Carrillo-Valles .
First , he said he spoke no English .
When a Spanish-speaking reporter called , he said he could not hear her and he hung up .

The case became a criminal investigation in April 2007 .
ICE agents called the Justice Department , saying Felhaber had just arrived at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing with $ 1.2 million .

Finding money is not a crime , but there are rules about its importation .
Import documents identified Carrillo-Valles as owning the $ 1.2 million .
Authorities believe that was a lie -- a violation carrying up to five years in prison .

But federal prosecutor William Cowden sat on his hands , in case Felhaber tried to exchange even more money .

He did .

This April , Felhaber returned with $ 5.2 million .
Investigators found no import documents this time , a smuggling violation that also carries up to five years in prison .

Prosecutors moved in .
Felhaber 's Treasury visits gave them probable cause to seize a combined $ 6.4 million .
Authorities told a federal magistrate they suspected it was buried drug money .

Stephen A. Schneider , an ICE investigator , dismissed every other explanation as 'conflicting and cockamamie stories. '

$ 6.4 million seized

Prosecutors do n't accuse Felhaber of involvement with drugs .
Court documents leave open the possibility that somebody stumbled across a cache of abandoned drug money in the Mexican desert .

Prosecutors plan to seek forfeiture of the seized $ 6.4 million , giving Felhaber and his family the opportunity to ask for the money back .
If they do , a judge will ask them to sort through the inconsistent stories .

Felhaber bristles at the suggestion there have been inconsistencies .

' The story has never changed, ' he says .

Cowden , the federal prosecutor , does n't know what to expect .
Sometimes , nobody shows up .

If so , the money will become government property .

Or at least some of it .
Perhaps there is $ 14 million still out there , waiting to be exchanged .

Does Felhaber know if there is ?

On that , it 's hard to get a straight answer .
