NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- First thing Tuesday morning , President Bush went on television again and solemnly declared , 'For the financial security of every American , Congress must act. '

But he did n't explain why he could only get one-third of his fellow Republicans in the House to vote for the bailout Monday .

Of course , we know why .
His approval rating is at 31 percent .

He is a classic lame duck in the waning days of his presidency .

And there is very little chance of him rallying the troops for this massive battle .

As for our next president.. .

& # 8226 ; John McCain solemnly declared , 'we are in the greatest financial crisis of our lifetimes .
' But he did n't explain why he could n't get more of his fellow Republicans on board for the bailout vote , either .

& # 8226 ; Barack Obama solemnly declared , 'This is one of those defining moments when the American people are looking to Washington for leadership. '

So where was he Monday , when 95 of his fellow Democrats voted against the bailout , too ?
iReport.com : Do you support a bailout ?

As for lawmakers on both sides of the aisle , let me just quote Tuesday 's Wall Street Journal editorial page .
It 's headlined : 'Congress lives up to its 10 percent approval rating ' and blasts 'a Washington elite that has earned every bit of the disdain that Americans have for it .
This crowd ca n't even make sausage. '

So where does that leave us ?
Now that we all have witnessed their collective face plant , can they , will they , hear our plea , and actually get their act together ?
