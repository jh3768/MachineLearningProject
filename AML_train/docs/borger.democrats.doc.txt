Borger: Do congressional Dems need intervention? - CNN.com
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Yes , it 's early .
Very early .
Barack Obama has n't even moved into Blair House yet .

But it 's time -- for an intervention .

How else to confront the oddly self-destructive behavior of congressional Democrats ?
How else to figure out why they seem intent on depriving their new president of a swift -- and truly bipartisan -- victory on his all-important economic stimulus package ?

It 's as if they have n't quite figured out what the public meant when it voted to change business as usual .
Or that sometimes , in order to get something done , the perfect is the enemy of the good , as the clich&eacute ; goes .
Or to effectively cripple the Obama presidency in its infancy would be , er , bad for them .

Sure , the griping Democrats are having visions of President Bill Clinton 's early deficit reduction plan which -- while a success -- made lots of them feel like Republicans .
And they do n't want to repeat the Republican rubber-stamp mind-set of blindly following a president for the last eight years -- into an unpopular war , an economic crisis , and finally , over the cliff .

What else could possibly have prompted Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to make the point that , 'I do not work for Barack Obama .
I work with him .
' Or , as my kids used to say , 'You 're not the boss of me .
' ( Reid is wrong ; my kids were right .

This is not to say that some of the Democratic complaints may not be perfectly well-founded and justified .
Maybe corporate tax breaks for companies hiring new employees is n't the best of ideas , as Sen. John Kerry suggests , because these companies might hire new people anyway .
And there are bound to be differences over the best ways to spend the huge federal pot of $ 775 billion or so over two years , or how to cut taxes as part of the plan .

But here 's the important part : Both spending and tax cuts have to be part of any stimulus package .
As one top transition aide explains to me , 'It 's hard to spend that much money over two years effectively without doing both. '

If there were eight years in which to spend the money , it might be different .
But the new administration is looking for what he describes as 'a very quick jolt -- and that 's hard to do without a combination of things. '

Do the corporate tax cuts help to bring in some GOP votes ?
Sure. But please explain why there is something wrong with that .

And , if Democrats are n't having enough fun , get ready for this fight in the near future -- over infrastructure .
Team Obama swears it intends to fund projects that are 'not constituency driven, ' as this source puts it , but in the federal interest .
Translation : no pet pork .

So if you think Democrats are behaving badly now , just wait .

It wo n't be long , though , because Obama wants a package by mid-February .
And sources tell me that his chief of staff , Rahm Emanuel , has made it very clear to his former colleagues that , while they 're listening to all ideas , they 're not in the mood to dawdle .

As Obama said Friday , he wants to try to 'get past the habit ' that ideas can be born out of one 'ideological corner ' or another .
' If you show me something that is going to work , I will welcome it. '

It may be hard for Democrats to move smoothly into a world in which they are in charge and responsible , but that 's their new normal .

Opposition requires keeping score ; leadership requires action .
And Democrats need an attitude adjustment .
