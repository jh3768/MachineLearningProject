All about algae: Can pond scum power our future? - CNN.com
HONG KONG , China ( CNN ) -- Thirty years ago , the last time the world faced an oil crisis , the U.S. Department of Energy ( DoE ) launched a program to analyze the potential algae had as a renewable fuel .
It did n't take it long to realize algae was a godsend .

Actually being able to take advantage of it was another matter .

The program , run by the DoE 's National Renewable Energy Laboratory ( NREL ) lasted nearly two decades , but by 1996 , it came to a close .
Getting an algae biodiesel program running was deemed economically unfeasible when faced with the technology costs at the time versus the costs of using other fuels .

At that time , the price of oil was less than $ 20 a barrel .

With oil prices now looking like they wo n't drop below $ 100 a barrel for some time -- if ever -- and technology costs relatively lower than a decade ago , algae 's time in the sun could finally have arrived .

The greenest of the green ?

Algae have been touted as the greenest of all green fuels and it 's not hard to see why .
They are oil-rich themselves , with some strands carrying more than 50 percent oil content .

They can grow in the most hostile of regions such as deserts so do n't infringe on land set aside for food crops .
They do n't require freshwater to flourish , and can thrive off saltwater or wastewater , making sewage farms a natural habitat .

Algae also reproduce at an astonishing rate ; they are able to double in size in a matter of hours .
They are amongst the fastest growing plants on Earth .

What make algae particularly useful as a feedstock is that they thrive off carbon dioxide ( C02 ) , which makes them great carbon sequesters .
That also means that the other natural places to cultivate algae are power stations .

The algae can absorb as much as 75 percent of the exhaust gas , claims U.S. firm GreenFuel Technologies , using its bespoke bio-reactor .
Algae does n't just grow in the sun , contrary to previous belief .
San Francisco start-up company Solazyme says it can now generate biofuels from algae grown in the dark .

The sun is replaced by sugar , essentially , which is fed to the algae , which then produces different types of oil that can be processed into a variety of fuels , suitable for cars and planes .
These algae produce more oil than they would in the sun , the company claims .

Compared to other types of feedstock , algae is incredibly productive .

Most agree it can eclipse any other type of fuel crop grown today -- palm oil can yield around 6,000 liters per hectare per year ( per/h/y ) of fuel , for example while algae can yield more than four times that amount .

Production : A murky issue

But there is some level of disagreement over just how productive algae is or can ever be .
Current yield estimates are 25,000 liters per/h/y , while conservative future yield predictions are around 50,000 liters per/h/y .
The more ambitious claims of productivity have been as high as a quarter of a million per h/y .

But micro-algae expert John Benemann PhD , who was part of the NREL algae task force , says this is little more than hype , arguing in a recent presentation that the figure of quarter of a million 'exceeds theoretical limit of photosynthesis' .

NREL itself said in its 1996 report that an area around the size of the U.S. state of Maryland -- approximately 15,000 square miles ( 3.8 million hectares ) -- would be enough to cultivate enough algae to serve the entire transportation needs of the U.S .

That would represent around 140 billion gallons ( 530 billion liters ) of biodiesel it said , working out at around 140,000 liters per h/y .
Achieving production levels of such a scale in theory is one thing however ; being able to do it in reality is another .

In 1996 , the DoE estimated that it would cost twice as much to produce algae-sourced biodiesel than it would gasoline .

Today , the University of New Hampshire 's ( UNH ) Biodiesel Group estimates it could cost as much as $ 308 billion to build enough farms across the U.S. to meet these production levels and another $ 47 billion to run them .

The U.S. currently spends up to $ 150 billion a year on importing oil , UNH says .

UNH says the technology is n't yet available to produce the yields algae are capable of producing anyway , and is seeking private financing in the absence of government funding to develop the technology further .

Just skimming the surface

There is also some dispute over the methods employed to farm algae .
Some believe closed methods of production such as bio-reactors are the only way to control conditions sufficiently to guarantee good quality feedstocks .

But proponents of open algae farms say their way is more productive - they have more space available to them - and they are cheaper to run .
New Zealand company Aquaflow Bionomic Corporation claims you can achieve productivity levels at an affordable rate .
In early 2006 it said it had successfully produced biodiesel crude from wild algae ( it is keeping the process secret ) .

This biodiesel generates 'at least as much energy as went into creating it, ' Aquaflow told The Guardian , claiming it is so cheap to produce that the company is planning on teaching local communities how to make it themselves so they can be self-sufficient .
