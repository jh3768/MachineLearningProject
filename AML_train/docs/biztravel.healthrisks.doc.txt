Business travelers exposed to health risks  - CNN.com
ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) -- Having traveled about 2 million miles for business during his career , Mark Hill , chief marketing officer for a fine art reproduction company , lists three downsides to flying so much : all the waiting and security hassles ; discomfort ; and winding up on the same plane with somebody who has a drug-resistant , sometimes fatal , form of tuberculosis .

Hill was on the Air France flight on May 12 from Atlanta to Paris , 16 rows away , he says , from Andrew Speaker -- the Atlanta lawyer who sparked congressional investigations by flying to Europe and back while infected with a rare form of tuberculosis , known as XDR TB .
Hill found out about it two weeks later on the news , along with other passengers .

Hill 's business-travel health scare is less common than most .
More everyday examples were the high-profile experiences of both Bush presidents .
George W. Bush came down with a stomach ailment after traveling to the Group of Eight summit last week in Germany -- recalling his father 's televised 'tiny bout of the flu ' 15 years ago during a summit in Tokyo .

Inevitably , a health scare in the news makes frequent travelers wonder : Am I at risk ?

Hill believes such risks are on the rise .
' I 'm not one of those people who get sick that easily ; I have a fairly high resistance, ' he says .
' But I run into a lot of people who get sick on flights. '

Dr. Phyllis Kozarsky , an expert on travelers ' health , explains the problem .
' We live in a globally mobile society and people have to understand that your risk is never zero wherever you go and whatever you 're doing. '

Kozarsky teaches medicine and infectious diseases at Emory University School of Medicine and is a consultant for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on traveler 's health .
She also co-edits CDC Health Information for the International Traveler , the latest edition of which is being published this month .

The doctor does not mean to sound alarmist about air travel .

' Yes , there are possibilities of acquiring illnesses on airplanes , if you 're sitting next to , or close to , somebody who has an illness that may be transmitted through the respiratory route , such as measles or the common cold, ' Kozarsky says .
' But if you 're on a bus , on a train or in a movie theater , or in any confined space for a period of time , you could face the same risk. '

In fact , she says , the air filtration systems in airplanes take out 99 percent of infectious material , far more efficient than the systems in most offices .

While it is true that more people are getting sick while traveling , that 's because more people are traveling -- statistics show that 900 million trips are taken every year internationally , Kozarsky says -- and the trips are increasingly to places that the average traveler would not have visited in the past .

The main risks for Americans traveling to developing nations fall into three categories :

Vaccine-preventable diseases

Insect-borne diseases

Gastrointestinal illnesses , such as diarrhea , which is caused by contaminated food and water

But this is misleading , Kozarsky says .
' In fact , the major cause of preventable deaths in American travelers is injuries. '

In any case , preventive measures can reduce the possibility of all these problems -- from making sure one 's vaccines are up-to-date to drinking only bottled water .

If business travelers are more at risk than the average traveler , it is because they are less likely to take the necessary precautions , Kozarsky says .

' They 're asked to travel somewhere in the developing world , they 're staying at a nice hotel , they think it 's just the same as going to Kansas City .
But it 's not the same. '

Savvy companies recommend or require their employees to seek advice from a travel health clinic at least a month before the trip .
( Local clinics may be found through the Web site of the International Society of Travel Medicine , http : //www.istm.org/ ) .
Kozarsky believes a good place to start any trip is to visit the CDC travel Web site , www.cdc.gov/travel .

' The lifestyle of the busy business traveler does n't lend itself to the greatest health maintenance, ' Kozarsky says .
' But traveler 's health is mostly common sense. '

For example , she says , business travelers should give themselves time to recover from the trip instead of scheduling meetings soon after they get back .

President Bush can be excused , however .
' Obviously his schedule is very hectic , but he has sleeping quarters on the plane , people monitor his food .
All this shows is that anybody can get sick at any time. '
