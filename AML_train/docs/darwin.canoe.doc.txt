Wife of 'Canoe Man' denies fraud charges - CNN.com
LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- The wife of a UK man who reappeared five years after he was believed drowned has been accused of defrauding insurance companies and lying to her own sons , UK news agencies report .

Anne Darwin , 56 , appearing at Teesside Crown Court in northern England Monday , denied nine charges of laundering money and six charges of deception , the UK 's Press Association reported .

Her husband John , a former prison officer and teacher , reappeared at a police station in central London in late 2007 -- five years after he was thought to have drowned off the coast of north-east England .
A coroner declared John Darwin dead in 2003 , 13 months after his disappearance .

Outlining the case against Anne Darwin , prosecuting lawyer Andrew Robertson said that the couple conspired to commit the fraud through 'shame and embarrassment ' at possible bankruptcy over mortgage repayments on a dozen properties , PA reported .

' It is the Crown 's case that she and her husband , John Darwin , obtained over & # 163 ; 250,000 by means of this fraud , and by the time the fraud was uncovered she had transferred the funds to Panama in Central America where she was then living, ' Robertson claimed , according to PA. 'The funds were invested in land , property and foreign bank accounts in her name .

' It was a scheme in which Anne Darwin not only played an equal and vital role but it was a role which she played with superb aplomb, ' the agency reported Robertson as saying .

' Her role was a positive one .
John Darwin , after supposedly disappearing , had simply to keep his head down so the falsity of his disappearance would not be rumbled by anybody. '

John Darwin pushed his canoe out to sea on March 21 2002 , the agency quoted the prosecution as saying , then rang his wife to collect him and drop him off at a rail station before she rang police to say he was missing .

A massive air and sea rescue operation was subsequently launched , with the kayak paddle recovered within 24 hours and the remains of Darwin 's kayak washed up two months later .

Robertson told the jury that Anne Darwin had also lied to her sons Mark , 32 , and Anthony , 29 , PA reported .
The prosecution also told the court it should ignore Anne Darwin 's defense that she was coerced into the fraud by her husband , adding that they should 'remember this was all done by her alone .
No John Darwin there piling on the pressure .
At this stage he was still hiding somewhere in the hills .
This was a sole performance by Anne Darwin. '

The case continues .
