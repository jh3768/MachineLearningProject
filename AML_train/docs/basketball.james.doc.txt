LeBron James to sit out pre-Olympic game - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- U.S. basketball star LeBron James has suffered a pre-Olympic injury scare at the team 's training camp in Las Vegas and will miss Friday 's warmup game against Canada .

The All-Star forward has been diagnosed with a mild right ankle sprain and did not practice with the team as they visited a high school .

' If the gold medal game was tomorrow , he 'd play, ' coach Mike Krzyzewski told the Associated Press .

' But we 're not playing the gold medal game , or a medal round game right now .
So we would rather be cautious right now .

' I would say right now LeBron would n't play on Friday, ' Krzyzewski added .
' I do n't think that 's a wise decision , especially if he has n't practiced. '

James injured his ankle when he landed on Kevin Durant 's foot during a Tuesday match between Team USA and a select squad of young NBA players .

James said it improved overnight , and he moved without a limp after reporters were admitted to the high school gym at the end of practice .
' It 's a lot better today than it was yesterday, ' he said .

Asked if he thought he could play against Canada , James said , 'Right now it 's probably a 'no, ' just for precautionary reasons .
But I will be ready once we hit the road. '

James has had problems with both ankles .

In January , James missed a game with the Cleveland Cavaliers because of an ankle sprain .
He returned to score 28 points in a victory over the Los Angeles Clippers on February 2 .

A few weeks later , James left a game against Boston late in the first half with an ankle injury .
X-rays were negative and James returned for the start of the second .

' I 've done it so many times , I do n't know if it 's right or left ( ankle ) , ' James said with a smile .

James and his fellow NBA stars are desperate to win a gold medal in Beijing as the United States looks to re-establish basketball dominance after having to settle for bronze in the 2004 Olympics in Athens .

They face a tough qualification group in Beijing , including hosts China and reigning world champions Spain , both of whom are boasting a host of current NBA stars .
