Suffer delays with wine bars, spas, gyms - CNN.com
( LifeWire ) -- Every week for more than a year of his travels , Jay Lenstrom , the chief executive of Chicago-based Radiate Group , got stuck for several hours at Charlotte Douglas International Airport in North Carolina .
He tried to make the best of it .

' I created my own little triathlon, ' said Lenstrom .
' I would record my time splits in a little book .
On morning delays I 'd go : one , Starbucks ; two , shoeshine ; three , rocking chairs .
On evening delays , it would be : one , shoeshine ; two , rocking chairs ; three , piano bar. '

These days , Lenstrom 's quest for an airport diversion to make the best of delays is far from unique as on-time performance continues to be dismal .

The U.S. Department of Transportation ranked Newark Liberty International Airport as the worst for on-time arrivals between January and August ; John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City was at the bottom for on-time departures .
New York 's other major airport , LaGuardia , also ranked near the bottom in both categories .

Maria Link , a homemaker and mother of two who recently moved with her family from Dallas to Dubai when her husband was relocated for work , is n't prepared to give LaGuardia Airport a break .

' I think someone needs to rip LaGuardia to shreds, ' she said .
' What a ( lousy ) place to be delayed .
Every flight in and out of that airport is delayed !
I despise that airport. '

If you can arrange to pass through certain airports , your travel trauma is likely to decrease .
Salt Lake City International Airport was No .
1 for on-time arrivals between January and August , while Portland ( Oregon ) International Airport was tops for on-time departures .
San Diego International Airport also did well , making both lists at No .

At the same time , airports are promoting services and amenities that can reduce some of the stress associated with delays -- like serenading stranded travelers with live music , tempting them with sophisticated wine bars and offering spas and gyms to work off their worries .

Spas and fitness centers

A massage or workout may be the best stress relief .
XpresSpa operates day spas in 11 departure terminals , including Dallas Fort Worth International Airport , Philadelphia and Kennedy in New York , offering foot massages and treatments including seaweed facials .

McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas boasts 24-Hour Fitness , where you can kick box or take a spinning class , while the Absolute Spa in Vancouver International Airport features yoga and a lap pool .
Hotels at terminals in Detroit Metro and Chicago O'Hare also have gyms open to the public for $ 15 per day or less. '

Live music , food and wine

Airports have struck upon music and food as a way to impart a sense of place while distracting travelers from the fact that they 're stuck in an airport .
Austin-Bergstrom International Airport features local musicians on weekday afternoons , celebrating the city 's reputation as the live music capital of the world .
Austin is also well represented by a number of local restaurants that have airport concessions , including The Salt Lick , a local barbecue institution .

Memphis International Airport features such offerings as the Memphis Rock ' n ' Soul Museum gift shop and the landmark Jim Neely 's Interstate Bar-B-Que , while at Boston Logan International Airport , passengers can savor New England clam chowder and fried clams at Legal Sea Foods ( and even get live lobsters to go ) .

What could be more appropriate at an airport than a wine flight ?
Vino Volo operates wine bars in five airports across the country with plans to add up to 10 additional outlets next year .

Kid-friendly features

For families , delays might be most trying of all .

' What makes the difference when delayed with kids is the airline lounges, ' said Maria Link .
' The Admirals Club at DFW has a special room for kids with computer games and cartoons. '

Several airports go a step further .
O'Hare features a play area in terminal two designed by the Chicago Children 's Museum .
San Francisco International Airport 's SFO Kids ' Spot in terminal three features a crawling apparatus and a plasma wall that shoots arcs of energized color when activated by sound .
Vancouver 's newly expanded international terminal has a man-made stream that leads to a 30,000-gallon aquarium filled with 850 sea creatures and a 1,000-gallon jellyfish tank .

Home away from home

If you must be delayed , one of the best airports to be stuck in is Singapore 's Changi International Airport , named the best airport in the world for the past two decades by Business Traveler magazine , which praises its 'smooth efficiency , calm atmosphere and wide range of facilities and services. '

Among the amenities the airport offers are exotic gardens , a two-hour tour of nearby Singapore , napping rooms , a movie theater and a full schedule of entertainment events including public appearances by music and sports stars .
The airport has even received the Golden Pillow Award from the Web site SleepingInAirports.com for 10 years running .

' All in all a great experience, ' wrote one visitor to Changi Airport on the Web site .
' I spent 20 hours there , and if I was n't so tired I easily could have spent another 20. '
