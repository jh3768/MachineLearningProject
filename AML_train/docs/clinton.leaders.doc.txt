Clinton starts working the phones to U.S. allies - CNN.com
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has phoned a slew of leaders since taking office on Thursday , reaching out to key allies in the Middle East , Asia and Europe as the Obama administration reviews foreign policies .

Clinton , who was sworn in Wednesday , has spoken with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni and Defense Minister Ehud Barak , as well as Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas , Jordan 's King Abdullah and the foreign ministers of Egypt and Saudi Arabia , according to acting State Department spokesman Robert Wood .

The calls were 'introductory ' and did not delve into the nuances of Middle East policy , despite a simmering crisis in Gaza and Thursday 's naming of former Sen. George Mitchell as a special envoy to the Middle East .

President Obama said Mitchell will help implement a cease-fire between Israelis and Hamas and support anti-smuggling efforts to prevent the latter from re-arming .

But he added , 'Lasting peace requires more than a long cease-fire , and that 's why I will sustain an active commitment to seek two states living side by side in peace and security. '

By naming Mitchell as his personal envoy , Obama is sending a diplomatic heavyweight to the region .

' He 's neither pro-Israeli nor pro-Palestinian, ' Martin S. Indyk , a former U.S. ambassador to Israel , told The New York Times .
' He 's , in a sense , neutral. '

Clinton also spoke with Afghan President Hamid Karzai , Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari and India 's foreign minister , Wood said .

On Friday , Clinton met with a group of visiting female Afghan legal professionals .

The fourteen judges , prosecutors and defense attorneys were in Washington on a State Department training program on justice reform in Afghanistan .

The State Department issued a statement about the meeting late Friday .
It was not on Clinton 's public schedule , and Wood did not mention the meeting at his daily press briefing when he discussed the secretary 's second day in office .

According to the State Department , Clinton praised the women 's 'bravery and courage ' for bringing reform to Afghanistan and reaffirmed President Obama 's commitment to stabilizing Afghanistan .

At her confirmation hearing , Clinton also pledged to focus more attention on women 's issues , especially in Afghanistan .

On Thursday , Obama and Clinton named Richard Holbrooke , former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , as a special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan .
Holbrooke negotiated the 1995 agreement at Dayton , Ohio , that ended the war in Bosnia .

Holbrooke called his latest mission 'a very difficult assignment. '

' Nobody can say the war in Afghanistan has gone well , and yet , as we speak here today , American men and women and their coalition partners are fighting a very difficult struggle against a ruthless and determined enemy without any scruples at all, ' he said after his appointment was announced .

Holbrooke said , 'If our resources are mobilized and coordinated and pulled together , we can quadruple , quintuple , multiply by tenfold the effectiveness of our efforts there. '

Amid an administration review of North Korea , Clinton also spoke to the foreign ministers of Japan , South Korea , China and Australia -- key allies working to disarm Pyongyang , the spokesman said .

She also spoke with the foreign ministers of India , Britain , France , Germany and the Czech Republic , which holds the rotating presidency of the European Union , Wood said .

The administration is also reviewing policy toward Iran , with Obama promising more engagement .
Wood said that Undersecretary William Burns would be seeking input from Britain , France , Germany , China and Russia , partners in the so-called 'P5 plus one ' group dealing with Iran 's nuclear program .

Sources said Dennis Ross , a Mideast peace envoy for previous administrations , will be an envoy in charge of engaging Iran , but it is unclear what role he 'll play .
