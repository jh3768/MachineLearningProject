Alfredsson wins dramatic Evian playoff - CNN.com
EVIAN-LES-BAINS , France ( AP ) -- Helen Alfredsson has won the Evian Masters for her first LPGA Tour title in five years after defeating rookie Na Yeon Choi at the third sudden-death playoff hole .

The 43-year-old Swede made a birdie on the par-five 18th on Sunday while the 20-year-old Choi , of South Korea , only managed par .

Alfredsson also won the Evian Masters , Europe 's richest women 's tournament , in 1994 and '98 .

However , she had not won a tournament since the 2003 Longs Drugs Challenge after battling a series of injuries .

Alfredsson , who shot a course-record 63 on Friday , birdied the last two holes in her final-round 67 to force a three-way playoff with Choi and Angela Park .

The 19-year-old Brazilian Park was eliminated at the first extra hole having led the tournament going into the final round .

' Someone is looking after me for ( Evian ) to be my next win, ' said Alfredsson .
' All my friends are here .
It is a very emotional place for me. '

Alfredsson 's 2007 season was ruined by long-standing back and hamstring problems and her ranking dropped below No .
100 .

The win at Evian , which is Europe 's richest women 's tournament with a prize purse of two million euros ( $ 3.25 million ) , is her sixth on the LPGA Tour and earned her a place in the season-ending ADT Championship .

' The money is not important, ' Alfredsson said .
' The satisfaction of winning and making putts , there is no money in the world that can pay for that .
Having memories and having to go through what I have gone through and coming out on top in the end. '

Alfredsson looked an unlikely winner when she made a bogey five at the 13th hole , leaving her five shots behind Choi who was at 17-under and threatening the Swede 's course record of 63 set on Friday .

Choi had seven birdies and a bogey on the front nine and took the outright lead at 14-under with a birdie on the 9th .
She then led the field by four strokes after another birdie at 13 .

' I thought my course record was going to fly out of the window, ' Alfredsson said .

But Choi dropped shots at 15 and 16 , while Alfredsson made a 10-foot birdie putt at the par-three 17th and then left her eagle putt at 18 close enough to make birdie and draw level .

Park started the day at 14-under but dropped two shots on the front nine .
She made birdies at 11 and 16 to close in on Choi and had a long eagle putt on 18 to win the tournament .

She had to settle for a birdie , but the 2007 Rookie of the Year failed to repeat the feat on the first playoff hole .

Jin Joo Hong of South Korea shot a 67 to be fourth on 13-under , two behind the leaders .

Top-ranked Lorena Ochoa , who led after a first-round 65 , shot 68 to place fifth a further shot behind .
The 26-year-old Mexican has never won at Evian , where she now has five top-five finishes .

Annika Sorenstam , the 2000 and '02 champion , shot 68 in her final round at Evian before retiring at the end of the season .

The 37-year-old Swede started the day 11 strokes back but pulled to within five of the lead by reeling off six birdies in the first 12 holes .
Her challenge faded with three straight bogies from 14 to 16 , and she ended with a seven-under total of 281 .

Her farewell to Evian was marked with a ceremony immediately after her round to dedicate the grassy scoreboard area as Annika Sorenstam Square .

' This was very special , a nice surprise, ' Sorenstam said .
' I feel like a big part of the Evian family .
I will always be here in spirit , for sure. '

Sorenstam 's final competitive event in Europe -- and final major -- is the British Women 's Open at Sunningdale , England , starting on Thursday .
