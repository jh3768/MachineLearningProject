Lance Armstrong, girlfriend expecting baby in June - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- Cycling legend Lance Armstrong -- a survivor of testicular cancer -- and girlfriend Anna Hansen are expecting a baby , CNN learned on Tuesday through his charitable organization .

The baby is due in June .

Armstrong was diagnosed in 1996 with testicular cancer that had spread to his brain , lungs and abdomen .

He underwent treatment for the disease and was able to return to cycling , eventually winning seven consecutive Tour de France 's .

The harsh chemotherapy left him unable to have children , although he and then-wife Kristin Richards had three children using sperm the cyclist had donated before the treatment .
Armstrong and Hansen , however , are expecting without the use of any artificial fertilization process .

' This is a hopeful thing for testicular cancer survivors, ' CNN medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said .
' It means his body healed from the chemotherapy and surgery. '

Armstrong retired from cycling after his seventh Tour de France win in 2005 , and focused his energy on the Lance Armstrong Foundation ( livestrong.org ) , which supports people affected by cancer .
Armstrong founded the organization in 1997 .

The 37-year-old Texan announced in September that he was launching a comeback with the goal of winning the Tour de France in 2009 .

' After talking with my children , my family and my closest friends , I have decided to return to professional cycling in order to raise awareness of the global cancer burden, ' he wrote on LiveStrong 's Web site .

He is training for several races leading up to the Tour de France , including Australia 's Tour Down Under and the Giro d'Italia .
