Judge refuses to delay case against USS Cole suspect - CNN.com
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- A military judge Thursday refused to delay proceedings against the accused mastermind of the bombing of the destroyer USS Cole despite President Obama 's call for a temporary halt to trials of suspected terrorists .

Obama ordered a 120-day delay of pending cases at the U.S. prison camp at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , on his first day in office , requiring prosecutors to seek delays in the 14 active cases before military commissions there .

But the judge , Col. James Pohl , refused the government 's request for a delay and ordered arraignment for Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri to go ahead as scheduled February 9 .

Obama 's order to stay proceedings is meant to give his administration time to review cases before the much-criticized military commission process , which the Bush administration set up to try prisoners accused of taking part in terrorist attacks on Americans .

White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Thursday that Pohl 's ruling wo n't affect the review .

' We are consulting with the Pentagon and the Department of Justice to explore our options in that case, ' Gibbs said .

The Office of Military Commissions , which manages the prosecutions , may have to temporarily drop charges against al-Nashiri to comply with the presidential order , said Cmdr .
Jeffrey Gordon , a spokesman for that agency .

Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell discounted that possibility but said that no proceedings against al-Nashiri would be going forward .

' The bottom line is , we all work for the president of the United States in this chain of command, ' Morrell said .
' And he has signed an executive order that has made it abundantly clear that until these reviews are done , all of this is on hiatus. '

Critics of the system have said that is one of the problems with the tribunals : that the courts are subject to the influence of officials up the chain of command .

The Pentagon announced in June that it would seek the death penalty against al-Nashiri .
U.S. officials have characterized him as al Qaeda 's former operations chief in the Arabian Peninsula .

But al-Nashiri has said he was tortured into confessing involvement in the bombing .
The CIA has admitted 'waterboarding ' him at a secret location in 2002 , and tapes of the interrogation were destroyed in 2005 .

The United States accuses al-Nashiri of terrorism , murder , attempted murder and destruction of property , among other charges .
