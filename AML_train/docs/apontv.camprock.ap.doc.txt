Can 'Camp Rock' be another 'High School Musical'? - CNN.com
LOS ANGELES , California ( AP ) -- Demi Lovato recalls with delight 'my first -- and my only !
-- fan mob scene. '

The 15-year-old had dropped by a friend 's autograph session at a Disney Studios event to say hi when suddenly a little girl shrieked her name .
Within seconds , hundreds of kids clutching pens and autograph books had surrounded her .

' I was like , 'What !
How do you even know me ?
' ' says Lovato , rising partly out of her chair , tossing up her hands in disbelief and bursting into laughter .

' But yeah, ' the actress adds quietly , regaining her composure .
' It was like , 'This is the coolest thing ever .

As the star of the latest Disney Channel original movie 'Camp Rock ' -- which the Mouse House hopes will be its next 'High School Musical ' -- it 's a scene Lovato might have to get used to .

' I 'm getting kind of anxious , and a little nervous , because there was a picture I saw the other day of Ashley and Vanessa, ' she says of 'High School Musical ' stars Ashley Tisdale and Vanessa Anne Hudgens .
' They were at a McDonald 's and there was paparazzi all over the place .

' I 'm excited , though .
For the most part, ' she concludes .

Only time will tell whether the Disney Channel can capture lightning in a bottle twice in the same decade .
Disney is clearly banking on it , however , rolling out buzz about the movie on the Internet for months , offering various 'Camp Rock ' tchotchkes and casting as co-stars the mega-hot pop group the Jonas Brothers .
( It airs June 20 at 8 p.m .
EDT. )

' People are expecting it to be the next 'High School Musical .
' That would be an honor if it is, ' says 14-year-old Alyson Stoner , who plays budding music producer Caitlyn Geller .

In the film , Lovato plays Mitchie Torres , a musical prodigy who ca n't afford to attend a prestigious music camp filled with snooty rich kids until her mother gets her a break on the tuition by landing them both jobs in the kitchen .

Once there , she 's befriended by miscreant rock star Shane Gray , played by 18-year-old Joe Jonas .
She 's also hounded by the rich girls , particularly after she 's outed as a kitchen worker , until one of them ( 17-year-old Anna Maria Perez de Tagle ) comes over to her side .

Then , in the time-honored tradition of kid musicals dating to the days of Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland , they bring everybody together for a show at which the irrepressible Lovato says happily , 'I get to rock the house. '

Indeed she does , say the Jonas Brothers .

' She 's a great singer .
We 're writing with her for her new record, ' 15-year-old Nick Jonas says by phone from Florida , where he was recently on tour with the band .

' And we 'll be introducing her on our 'Burning Up ' tour this summer, ' pipes up his 20-year-old brother , Kevin .

As was the case when the first 'High School Musical ' film debuted in 2006 , most of its teen stars , although unknown to mainstream audiences , already have followings among the demographic of 8- to 13-year-olds .

Lovato developed a cult following as one of the stars of 'As the Bell Rings, ' the five-minute mini-show Disney uses to fill breaks between its regular programming .
Stoner , who appeared in both of the 'Cheaper by the Dozen ' films , voices Phineas ' precocious girlfriend in the Disney cartoon series 'Phineas and Ferb .
' Perez de Tagle , whose grandmother is prominent Philippine singer-actress Sylvia La Torre , plays the tone-deaf singer , Ashley DeWitt , on the Disney series 'Hannah Montana. '

' And I 'm an actual singer !
' she says emphatically .

' Being able to finally sing good on 'Camp Rock ' is ... ' she adds before dissolving into laughter during a recent interview at a Hollywood studio .

There , the actresses have scattered laptop computers , cell phones , schoolbooks and stuffed animals across tables as they rush off to pose for pictures between bites of lunch .

They say they became friends years before their current project , having bumped into one another at auditions and acting classes .

' I met Demi on a show called 'Just Jordan, ' ' says Perez de Tagle .
' Ever since then we kept in touch .
She visited me on the set of 'Hannah Montana ' and we switched phone numbers .
And then , all of a sudden , we were like , 'We 're going to be on 'Camp Rock ' !

The three say the friendships made filming the movie easier .

Even when they had to dance all day long for days on end , they had each other for support , says Lovato .

And even when the movie 's producers took them to a remote location in Canada , 'where there was no Internet or phone service and there were bears, ' they still had one another , Stoner adds .
