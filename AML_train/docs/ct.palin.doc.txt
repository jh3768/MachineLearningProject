Palin's star rises - CNN.com
The people of Alaska boast that they have the coldest state in the U.S. and 'the hottest governor. '

In her younger days , Sarah Palin did come in second in the Miss Alaska beauty pageant but that 's not the point .

Republican John McCain named her just one week ago as his surprise pick for the vice presidency .
This week , she was the star of the Republican National Convention and became the most talked-about person in America .

They are right in Alaska ; she is a hot commodity , though the Republicans may yet get burned .

Most Americans have only started getting their first glimpse of Palin , but some of her appeal is obvious .
She is a compelling public speaker : strong , sentimental and sarcastic .

Her speech to the convention showed her range and persuasive power .
She communicated warmth , wit and maternal pride in her family , but then switched to fierce partisanship and a caustic critique of her Democratic opponents .
She 's good .

And she buries every stereotype in the snow .
She hunts moose and eats what she kills .
She 's a crusader against corruption who 's taken on powerful ( male ) politicians and prevailed .
Polls suggest she may be the most popular governor in the country .

Palin also manages the state while raising five children .
( She gave birth to her youngest less than five months ago , reportedly returning to work with her newborn in tow just days later ) .

Why would n't America support a woman like that ?

Her 17-year-old daughter 's pregnancy notwithstanding , she does n't want public schools to teach about birth control .
But she would like them to discuss 'Creationist ' alternatives to the Theory of Evolution .

Palin opposes abortion in all cases , even to end a pregnancy that 's the result of rape .

Lawmakers in Alaska have also launched an investigation into whether Palin misused her authority , allegedly trying to get her sister 's estranged husband fired from his job as a police officer .

But opponents say Palin 's biggest potential problem may be that her government experience consists only of being the mayor of a tiny remote town , and then the governor of a sparsely populated , remote state .

At the same time , Palin is already delivering an important demographic for the McCain campaign .
As a centrist in his party , McCain was openly opposed by some of its most stalwart and active supporters : Christian conservatives .

Now that Palin is on his side , some of their leaders have announced that they are too .

She could deliver women , diminishing the 'gender gap ' that tends to give a majority of men 's votes to the Republicans , and women to the Democrats .
Hillary Clinton got 18 million votes in the primaries and the Republicans are hungry for them .

And finally Palin reinforces McCain reputation as a Washington outsider .
He is in fact a familiar face in the politics of the US capital , but she comes as far away as anyone on the continent can .

We 'll see .
Her appearance at the Republican convention this week was a complete , standing-ovation success .

John McCain has been eclipsed so far in this campaign by the excitement about two candidates he campaigned against : Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama .

Now he may be eclipsed for a time by the candidate he chose to run with : Sarah Palin of Alaska .
