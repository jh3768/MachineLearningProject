Bush meets with Italian ally on Europe tour - CNN.com
ROME , Italy ( CNN ) -- U.S. President George W. Bush 's farewell tour of Europe took him to Rome on Thursday , where he met with his friend and ally , Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi .

Iran and Afghanistan were high on the agenda but at a news conference Bush was also asked about a U.S. Supreme Court blow to his administration 's war on terror policies .

Bush said he disagreed with the ruling that Guantanamo Bay detainees have the right to challenge their detention in federal courts , but he would abide by it .

' Congress and the administration worked very carefully on a piece of legislation that set the appropriate procedures in place as to how to deal with the detainees, ' he said .

' We 'll study this opinion , and we 'll do so with this in mind to determine whether or not additional legislation might be appropriate so that we can safely say , truly say to the American people .
' We are doing everything we can to protect you .

During a joint news conference with Berlusconi , Bush said Iran must give up its ambitions for nuclear power for the sake of peace or else face continued sanctions and isolation .

Bush insisted there was still a diplomatic way to solve the Iranian nuclear issue but that 'the choice is up to ( Iran ) , ' saying that it 's the Iranian people who are suffering and 'whose lives could be more hopeful. '

Bush said that all countries have a right to seek nuclear energy but only for civilian use .
The U.S. , and some other Western nations , believe Iran 's program is a mask to develop nuclear weapons .

Berlusconi , known for his flamboyant style , has remained one of Bush 's staunchest allies in Europe over the years .
The Italian began his second term as prime minister in 2001 , months after Bush entered the White House and shortly before the September 11 attacks .

Berlusconi has remained one of Bush 's staunchest allies in Europe over the years .

In exchange for easing fighting restrictions on its soldiers deployed in Afghanistan , as requested by NATO and the United States , Italy wants a greater role in dealing with Iran 's nuclear threat .

Iran was also a major topic during Bush 's stops this week in Germany , where he met with Chancellor Angela Merkel , and Slovenia , where he met with Slovenian and EU leaders .

Berlusconi 's support for Bush has been important , especially where the issue of troops for Iraq and Afghanistan have been concerned .
Italy initially contributed troops to the war in Iraq but no longer has troops in the country ; it still takes part in the NATO mission in Afghanistan .

Iraq could have also been one of the things that cost Berlusconi reelection in 2006 .
Polls show a majority of Italians oppose the war , and voters clearly did n't believe Berlusconi when he said he tried to convince the U.S. president not to invade Iraq .
But Berlusconi still won reelection in April this year .

Bush plans to meet with Pope Benedict XVI at the Vatican on Friday before traveling on to France and Britain .

Leading up to his afternoon meeting with Berlusconi , Bush held a roundtable discussion Thursday morning with Italian entrepreneurs who worked or will work at U.S. companies in Silicon Valley in California .
He then met with Italian President Giorgio Napolitano at Rome 's Quirinale Palace .
On Friday , Bush planned to meet with Pope Benedict XVI at the Vatican before traveling on to France and Britain .
