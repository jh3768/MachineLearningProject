The long journey to delivery - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- Singapore Airlines received its first A380 superjumbo on 15 October Monday , ready for the first commercial flight between Singapore and Sydney on Thursday 25 October .
The wait is over .
But getting to this point has been a long , and at times arduous , journey .

The superjumbo concept was first conceived in 1991 when Airbus began talks with major international carriers about requirements for a super-large passenger aircraft .

Two years later in January 1993 , Boeing joined the Airbus partners Aerospatiale , Daimler-Benz Aerospace Airbus , Construcciones Aeronauticas and British Aerospace in the studies .

But later that year in June 1993 , the U.S. airline pulled out , opting instead to research smaller jumbos .
( The culmination of this - the 787 Dreamliner - is due next year .

Airbus formed its Large Aircraft Division in 1996 .
And in 2000 it launched the A3xx project , that was later to become A380 .

The Airbus consortium became a single integrated company in 2001 , comprising four partners from France , Germany , Spain and Great Britain .

In January 2002 , work began on manufacturing key components and two years later in February 2004 , the first engines were delivered by Rolls Royce to the Airbus HQ in Toulouse .

Once the first wing was completed in April 2004 in Broughton , Wales , assembly began in the giant & # 163 ; 240-million French factory .

The first bad news arrived in December 2004 when Airbus ' owner , EADS announced the A380 project was & # 163 ; 1 billion over budget .

On April 27 2005 the A380 took its maiden flight from Toulouse to Bay of Biscay for four hours .

In June 2005 the delay annoucements began , when Airbus said it was six months behind delivery schedule .

In March 2006 it passed its evacuation test , with 850 passengers and 20 crew members evacuating the plane in 80 seconds with half the exits blocked .

But in June 2006 , it was time to announce another six-month delay .
The French airline then slashed its 2007 delivery numbers from 25 to nine and announced a $ 2.5-billion profit warning .
EADS ' shares plunged by 26 percent .

In June 2006 , cabin-fitting , paint shop and delivery centers in Hamburg closed down and workload transferred to Toulouse to cut transport costs .

In July 2006 , Gustav Humbert , Airbus CEO resigned , along with Noel Forgeard , EADS , co-CEO .
Christian Streiff stepped in to replace Humbert .

BAE agreed to sell its 20 percent stake in Airbus to EADS for $ 3.53 billion and on September 18 2006 , Airbus announced delays for third time and said customers would get deliveries up to two years late .

In response , Emirates warned its order was 'up in the air' .
And a month later it was told planes would be a further 10 months late .

In October 2006 , Christian Streiff resigned as Airbus CEO and Louis Gallois took over .
Virgin Atlantic deferred its order for four years to 2013 .

But in October 2006 Airbus also received a fresh order from Qantas for eight more A380s - its first fresh order in 18 months .

But Fedex cancelled its order of 10 A380s on November 8 2006 .

The super jumbo reached its final step to certification on November 13 2006 with the technical route proving mission .
The A380 visited 10 airports , covered 127,788km and crossed both North and South Poles in 18 days and some 152 flight hours .

In December 2006 , Singapore Airlines bought nine more A380s .

That month , the Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines received joint European Aviation Safety Agency and FAA Type Certification .

But more bad news hit in February when Airbus announced 10,000 jobs cuts and plants up for sale .
In March UPS cancelled its $ 3 billion order of 10 A380-800Fs .

A 12-day commercial route proving mission was performed in March 2007 in conjunction with Lufthansa , landing in JFK , ORD , IAD , HKG , FRA and MUN .

The seat auction began on August 27 2007 for seats on Singapore Airlines ' first commercial flight .
All donations have gone to Singapore 's Community Chest , Sydney Children 's Hospital , Randwick , Children 's Hospital , Westmead and Medecins sans Frontieres .

On October 15 2007 A380 is delivered to Singapore Airlines , Toulouse .
And at long , long last on October 25 2007 , the first commercial flight of the Airbus A380 Super jumbo took off from Singapore to Sydney .
