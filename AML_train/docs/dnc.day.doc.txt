Obama expected to address change in speech - CNN.com
DENVER , Colorado ( CNN ) -- The Democratic National Convention wraps up Thursday with Illinois Sen. Barack Obama , the party 's presidential nominee , addressing about 75,000 people at Invesco Field at Mile High .

' Obama will communicate the urgency of the moment , highlight the struggles Americans are facing and call on Americans to come together to change the course of our nation, ' the Democratic National Convention Committee said in a statement .

Obama became the first African-American to lead a major party 's ticket for the White House on Wednesday .
His rival for the nomination , Sen. Hillary Clinton of New York , interrupted a roll-call vote to ask that he be nominated by acclamation , or voice vote .

It was a carefully choreographed maneuver designed to unite the party after the bitter primary battle between Obama and Clinton .

The convention 's theme for Thursday is 'Change You Can Believe In, ' a slogan borrowed from Obama 's successful quest for the Democratic nomination .

Prominent speakers who are scheduled to address Democrats on Thursday include Gov .
Bill Richardson of New Mexico , who competed for the nomination before backing out and endorsing Obama , and Gov .
Tim Kaine of Virginia , who was among those mentioned as possibilities to become Obama 's running mate .

Former Vice President Al Gore , the party 's presidential nominee in 2000 , is also scheduled to speak .

In addition , Democrats plan a tribute to the Rev .
Martin Luther King Jr. , who delivered his famous 'I Have a Dream ' speech in Washington , D.C. , exactly 45 years ago , on August 28 , 1963 .

Two of King 's children , the Rev .
Bernice King and Martin Luther King III , plan to participate in the tribute after remarks from Rep. John Lewis of Georgia , who switched his allegiance from Clinton to Obama during the contentious primary contest .

Obama will formally accept his party 's presidential nomination in a speech that is scheduled to start at 8 p.m. local time ( 10 p.m. ET ) .

It promises to be the main event after a week of rousing speeches at the Pepsi Center in Denver , Colorado , by Democratic heavyweights , including Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts , who underwent surgery for a brain tumor June 2 , and Clinton , who urged her supporters to back Obama .

On Wednesday night , Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware formally accepted the vice presidential nomination and praised Obama as a leader who had been right on a wide range of issues , including Afghanistan .

' On the most important national security issues of our time , John McCain was wrong and Barack Obama has been proven right, ' he said .

Also on Wednesday , former President Bill Clinton declared Obama 'ready to be president of the United States ' after months of attacks from his wife 's supporters on the Democratic nominee 's lack of experience .

The former president himself was among the most outspoken proponents of that line of criticism of Obama .
On Wednesday night , however , he reversed himself and pointed out that Republicans had used the same line of attack against him when he first ran for president .

' It did n't work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history, ' Bill Clinton said .
' It wo n't work in 2008 because Barack Obama is on the right side of history. '

The former president said Obama 'will lead us away from the division and fear of the last eight years and back to hope. '

During a brief appearance after Biden 's speech Wednesday night , Obama said he believed that 'change is brought about because ordinary people do extraordinary things. '

He said he chose to speak Thursday at Invesco Field at Mile High , which seats 76,000 people , to make sure 'everybody who wants to can come .
... I think we will have a great night .
I look forward to seeing you there .

The Republican National Convention is scheduled to start Monday in Minneapolis-St. Paul , Minnesota , but the presumptive Republican nominee , Sen. John McCain of Arizona , may make headlines before then .

Several Republican sources told CNN late Wednesday that McCain has decided on his choice of a running mate .
Some suggested that reporters could learn that person 's identity as early as Thursday night not long after Obama 's acceptance speech .
