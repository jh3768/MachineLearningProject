Argentine president drops farm tax after mass protests - CNN.com
BUENOS AIRES , Argentina ( CNN ) -- Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner is dropping an agricultural export tax that has provoked months of protests from farmers , a spokesman said Friday .

Chief of Cabinet Alberto Fernandez said in a televised address that Fernandez had signed a decree canceling the tax .
She had imposed the 44 percent export tax -- which applied to soybeans , wheat , corn and sunflower seeds -- on March 11 without consulting Congress .

The move to drop the tax comes a day after the country 's Senate narrowly rejected the tax , with Vice President Julio Cobos casting the decisive vote .
The lower house , the Chamber of Deputies , had already approved the increase .

Cobos ' tie-breaking vote followed two split ballots of 36-36 , and more than 17 hours of debate .

' This does n't mean that I am betraying anyone, ' Cobos said .
' I am acting according to my convictions. '

The tax was the cause of a four-month standoff between the government and farmers .

Farmers sporadically cut off transportation routes in Argentina in an effort to hit the government 's coffers .
In those cases , food normally shipped to Europe and Asia did not make it to port .

In a concession to her critics , the president said last month that she was sending the measure to Congress to debate .

Fernandez had argued that the export tax paid for government increases in seniors ' pensions and help for the poor , and she had rejected the farmers ' demand for a repeal , calling their actions 'extortion. '

Argentina is the world 's second-largest corn exporter and third-largest soybean supplier .
The farming sector is widely credited with helping the country rebound from a devastating economic crisis in 2001 .
