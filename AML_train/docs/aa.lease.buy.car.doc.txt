Should you lease or buy a car? - CNN.com
( AOL Autos ) -- Car leasing is a lot like renting an apartment ; you pay a monthly fee to use it but do n't own it -- and are n't making payments toward ownership .
The leased vehicle remains the property of the lessor -- the company that issued the lease .

As with an apartment rental contract , car leasing will have a fixed period -- typically two or three years .
You 're obliged to make monthly payments for the length of the contract .
While you can get out of the lease before then if you want to , there will typically be extra costs -- for example , an 'early termination charge ' -- typically spelled out in the car leasing contract you sign .

And as is often the case with renting an apartment , you 'll likely have to put down some cash as 'security deposit ' at the lease inception .
This money will be used to pay for any damages to the vehicle -- such as door dings , stains on the seats , any needed service work , etc. -- when you return it at the end of the car leasing term .

A big advantage of car leasing is flexibility .
You are n't making a long-term commitment .
Typically , car leasing is for a relatively short period , 2-3 years being the norm .
The average new car loan , on the other hand , is five years .
When the lease period is up , you can simply bring the car back and walk away .

Or you can buy it if you like by paying off the remaining balance -- called the 'residual value ' -- which you 'll negotiate in advance at the time of lease inception .

Or go shopping for a new car -- or no car at all .

You have many choices .

Also , since you are only renting the car , your total cash outlay should be less .
You wo n't have to make as large a down payment ( a security deposit and the first month 's payment are the typical initial out-of-pocket fees associate with car leasing ) as you would if you were buying .

And monthly lease payments are almost always less than payments would be if you bought the car .
That means you 'll have more money left over to spend on other things .

Or , if you prefer , you can 'afford ' to drive a more expensive car when you lease , since the monthly payments will be comparatively lower .
This is one of the biggest single attractions of car leasing for many people .
A car ( or truck ) that might cost you $ 500- $ 600 per month to buy might cost $ 100 per month less with car leasing .

Another nice thing about car leasing is that you 're always driving a new or nearly new vehicle .
And of course you do n't have to worry about the potentially expensive repair and/or maintenance problems that inevitably crop up as a car ages -- and gets out of warranty .

The leased car will typically be under factory warranty for the duration of the lease -- and car leasing contracts often have add-on provisos that cover routine maintenance , such as oil changes , etc. AOL Autos : Cheap luxury cars

Car leasing may also have tax advantages for you -- but this is something you 'll have to ask your accountant about .
In the past , most people who did car leasing were those who used their vehicle for business , such as realtors -- and who therefore could claim deductions for car leasing not available to those who purchased them outright .

Car leasing had the additional attraction of freeing up assets for investments and so on that would otherwise be locked into a depreciating asset -- the person 's car or truck .

There are downsides to car leasing , of course .
Since you 're only making what amount to rental payments each month , you wo n't have anything tangible to show for your money at the end of the lease .
If you spend , say , $ 12,000 on car leasing payments ( about $ 450 per month ) over two years , that money is gone forever .

A person who buys his vehicle , on the other hand , has the comfort of knowing that one day , it will be 'paid for ' and -- assuming it is still in good shape at that point -- will provide 'free transportation ' until it breaks down or the owner decides to get rid of it .

In addition , a person who owns his car has equity ( cash value ) in the car or truck .
Even though it will continue to depreciate with each passing year , so long as it 's still serviceable transportation , it will always be worth something .
That value can be used as a trade-in ; or the vehicle can be sold privately to help raise money to pay for a new one -- or for some other need .

The person who opts for car leasing must start from scratch every time .

There 's also the mileage issue .
If you decide on car leasing , your contract will typically stipulate the maximum number of miles you 're allowed before the end of the lease .
If you exceed that figure , it can get expensive .

Per-mile charges over the stated maximum listed in the car leasing contract are often exorbitant -- so if you drive more than the allowed miles in the contract annually , leasing could turn out to be more expensive then you thought .

The person who owns his car , meanwhile , can drive it as much as he wants , and do pretty much whatever he feels like with it , too .
He can swap out the stereo , add different wheels and tires , change the exhaust system -- whatever .
Do this with a leased car and you 'll have to pay whatever if takes to put the car back the way it was .
If you own your vehicle , the inevitable door dings and dents -- as well as coffee stains on the seat -- can also be shrugged off .

People who lease their vehicles , on the other hand , can expect to be charged for every nick , tear or spill at the end of the lease .
The cost of these repairs will be deducted from the security deposit .

Car leasing is also more complex than buying so always closely read -- and be sure you understand -- every proviso of the lease contract before you sign .
If you 're unclear about anything , get expert advice -- or walk away .
