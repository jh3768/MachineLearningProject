Study: 1 in 4 mammals at risk of extinction - CNN.com
BARCELONA , Spain ( CNN ) -- Nearly a fourth of the world 's mammals are threatened with extinction , a leading international conservation group said Monday as it unveiled its latest global study of the problem .

At least 1,141 of the 5,487 mammals on Earth , or 21 percent , are endangered species , the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) said at the start of its World Conservation Congress in Barcelona .

The problem appears to be getting worse since the IUCN 's last comprehensive survey of mammals 12 years ago , the IUCN 's Jan Schipper told CNN .
But he added that more study will be needed in the coming months .

The IUCN , in updating its trademark Red List of Threatened Species , emphasized that conservation efforts could help turn the tide .

' Hundreds of species could be lost as a result of our own actions , a frightening sign of what is happening to the ecosystems where they live, ' Julia Marton-Lefevre , IUCN 's Director General , said in prepared statement .
' We must now set clear targets to reverse this trend. '

The IUCN study also showed that 5 percent of the mammals currently listed as facing possible extinction are showing signs of recovery in the wild .
And just 76 mammals have become extinct in the last 500 years , the IUCN said .

But the study said 188 mammals are critically endangered , including the Iberian Lynx , which has at most 143 adults remaining .
They are on a steady decline mainly because there 's a shortage of their primary prey , the European Rabbit .

Another 29 species were listed as critically endangered and possibly extinct , such as Cuba 's Little Earth Hutia , which has not been seen in 40 years , the IUCN said .

The Swiss-based IUCN , founded 60 years ago , has a membership of more than 80 nations and 800 non-governmental agencies like environmental groups , and also counts on 11,000 volunteer scientists around the globe .

The latest study citing the danger to mammals involved 1800 scientists in 130 nations .
It showed that China 's 'Pere David 's Deer, ' already listed as extinct in the wild , is showing signs of recovery in captivity and that relaunching it in the wild may soon be attempted .

Schipper said that although the study put 21 percent of the world 's mammals on the endangered list , it might be as high as 36 percent , pending further study , particularly for 836 mammals for which scientists still have little incomplete information .

The new study is far more comprehensive than the last major study in 1996 , and includes 700 more mammals , IUCN officials told CNN .

Enhanced study methods and tracking of mammals and other species -- marine species , plants and insects -- has increased dramatically since 1996 , which makes it hard to compare the current results with those of 12 years ago , Schipper said .

In just one example , Schipper said , the lemur , a primate in Madagascar , was thought to have been just one species there in 1996 , but further study has shown three different species of lemurs , separated by rivers or valleys .

The IUCN said the loss or degradation of natural habitats is affecting 40 percent of the world 's mammals , particularly in Latin America , much of Africa and in southeast Asia .
Overharvesting is wiping out larger mammals in many locations .

Overall , the IUCN Red List now includes 44,838 species of all categories -- mammals and other species -- of which 38 percent are threatened with extinction .

Nearly a third of amphibians alone face extinction or have already become extinct , the IUCN said .

Barcelona 's zoo has a number of mammals on the endangered list , including the Chimpanzee , Red Panda , Variegated spider monkey , Sumatran Tiger and African hunting dog , zoo and IUCN officials told CNN .

The zoo -- not far from the IUCN congress that has brought thousands of government officials , environmentalists and scientists to the city for the conference which is held every four years -- has made conservation of endangered species a key part of its work , zoo officials told CNN .
