In one quake-hit town, survivors scavenge - CNN.com
QINGCHUAN , China ( AP ) -- Dozens of men and women swarm over the mounds of debris of this ruined city , an eerie replay of the early days following China 's devastating earthquake .

They are not searching for the missing and dead from the May 12 quake , which killed tens of thousands .
Nor are they looking for lost belongings .

Instead , many are scavenging for any bit of scrap metal to sell so they can buy food and other necessities .

For the estimated 5 million homeless quake refugees in Sichuan province , the slow path to rebuilding their lives is lined with huge challenges .

Supplies of food and water are adequate for now , but shelter is limited , with a severe shortage of tents .
The longer-term need for jobs and income has yet to be addressed by China 's leaders .

Many refugees are n't waiting for the government ; they are taking desperate measures to survive on their own .

As in other quake-hit towns , survivors in northern Qingchuan have discovered that recycling companies want the scrap metal from twisted and crumbled buildings .

Standing atop an enormous pile of rubble that was once a three-story building , Mao Honglin meticulously searched for the dull glint of metal .
Spotting a pointed tip , he pulled out a twisted length of steel .

' It takes money to buy anything and everything .
Now our house is collapsed , and I have nothing .
I need the money for basics , to buy salt and cooking oil, ' said Mao , 37 , a short , wiry man in orange shorts and soiled white gloves .

Stooped over beside him was his 33-year-old wife , Dong Shengfang , digging with her bare hands .
The two have been hunched over in the dust and debris for hours since dawn .

' Even before the quake , we were already very poor, ' she said during a short break .

' He had no fixed job ; he only did a little labor, ' making about $ 4- $ 6 a day , she said .
' But now even that is gone. '

The start of 2008 had been a new beginning for the family , Dong said .
They had begged relatives and friends for loans of $ 4,200 .
They had managed to get a 430-square-foot ( 40-square-meter ) apartment that was home to seven people -- the couple , their three children , and Mao 's mother and brother .

Now the entire building is a pile of rubble .

' We borrowed all this money to buy a second-hand apartment at the beginning of the year .
We now owe a lot of money .
How will we repay it ?
' she said .

Although Chinese banks have been ordered to forgive debts owed by earthquake survivors who lack insurance , it 's not certain such help would extend to Mao and his family .

Overwhelmed , she began crying as her husband lifted a gentle hand to wipe away her tears .

The two have joined others who have been coming for several days to one of dozens of demolished sites around town , after hearing that local salvage companies would pay about 7 cents for each pound of metal .

At the same site was Li Hongshen , a 52-year-old janitor , who was swinging a crude pickax to crush blocks of concrete to extract the scrap metal .

' There 's no other way to make money, ' he said , shrugging almost apologetically .
' I feel a little bit guilty because so many people died here but I have my family to support. '

He is caring for his wife , two daughters and an elderly mother .
Their home collapsed during the quake , and they are living in a makeshift lean-to made of plastic tarp and wooden boards near the side of the road .

' What the government gives us is enough, ' he said , referring to the regular rations of bottled water , instant noodles , and biscuits given out by aid workers .
' But food and water are n't everything in life .
In the future , we need to rebuild our homes and that takes money. '

Fellow survivors have discovered other quake-related , albeit dangerous , ways to earn hard cash .

Burly and bearded , farmer Lin Cenyou , 38 , was taking a break from his new job -- venturing into badly damaged buildings to haul out the belongings of other refugees .

' They tell me what they want , and I go get it, ' he said with a nonchalance that belies his precarious new profession .
' It 's a little dangerous , but I do n't fear anything now .
I just need money to feed my family. '

Scores of aftershocks have rumbled across the disaster zone , collapsing thousands of buildings .
At least eight people have been killed in buildings that fell since the quake , state media have reported .

Lin , who lives in a mountain village an hour 's hike away , heads into Qingchuan at 5 : 30 a.m. each day , offering his muscles for cash .
He can make up to $ 7 a day retrieving furniture , TVs and appliances , well worth the risk , he said .

Still , he has had a couple of close calls .
Lin rolled up his sleeves and pants to show bruises and scratches on his arms and legs .
Earlier this week , a powerful aftershock in Qingchuan sent a chunk of a plaster falling on him as he was inside an apartment building .

' What else can I do ?
' he said .
' I have no choice now .
I am a farmer with nothing left to farm. '

On a crowded street near scores of blue refugee tents , a handful of mom-and-pop merchants lucky enough to salvage their wares set their goods on display -- bags of spices , bottles of soft drinks , bunches of dried noodles .

Customers are scarce , but the vendors say even a small sale helps .

Vegetable seller Zhou Xiaomei , 30 , got a loan from her regular suppliers in a nearby city and received half a truckload of fresh produce this week that she displayed on the sidewalk -- plump eggplants , piles of crisp green peppers , ripe tomatoes and mounds of pungent garlic .

The day before , an old man picked out $ 6 worth of vegetables , even though he had only about 14 cents with him , she said .

' We gave it to him anyway, ' said Zhou , who added that she lost everything in the quake except the clothes in which she ran out of the house .

' They try to pay what they can .
Now is not the time for business .
We need to help each other, ' she said .
