Education chief favors longer school year - CNN.com
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Those lazy days of summer may become a thing of the past if the new secretary of education has his way .

Arne Duncan , the Cabinet secretary charged with overhauling America 's educational system , is studying programs that keep kids in school longer to boost their academic achievements .

' When I go out and talk about that , that does n't always make me popular with students .
They like the long summers, ' Duncan said in an interview Wednesday with CNN conducted in the Education Department 's library .

But Duncan said American students are 'at a competitive disadvantage ' because the United States has shorter school years than other countries such as India and China .

' It does n't matter how poor , how tough the family background , socioeconomic challenges, ' Duncan said .
' Where students have longer days , longer weeks , longer years -- that 's making a difference. '

More time in school is one of several ideas under consideration as Duncan settles into his new role .

The lanky former college basketball player and father of two speaks quickly , with remarkable energy in the face of daunting challenges .

Thirty percent of high school students drop out before graduation , and another 50 percent wo n't finish college , according to Education Sector , a nonprofit think tank .

For Latino and African-American students , the numbers are more dramatic .
About half of them will graduate from high school , the Washington-based group said .

As school administrators struggle with dropout rates , they also are confronting drastic budget cuts amid national economic uncertainty .
Districts are slashing jobs and putting off plans to repair crumbling school buildings .

' What 's going on , state after state , due to this tough economy , is devastating educationally .
And we ca n't afford to get worse now .
We have to get dramatically better, ' said Duncan , former chief of Chicago Public Schools .

President Obama and lawmakers have directed billions of dollars to the Department of Education through the stimulus package , and they propose to send more in the 2010 budget Obama announced Thursday .

Duncan said some of that money will provide schools with immediate relief to keep teachers .

' Thanks to the stimulus package , we have the chance to save literally hundreds of thousands of teacher positions .
This is a huge , huge deal, ' he said , citing a University of Washington study that suggests 600,000 teachers could be lost this year without drastic intervention .

' We 're going to be able to avert maybe not all of those cuts but a huge percentage of those , and that 's very very important, ' he said .

But the new funds may be only enough to keep a crisis at bay , said Kevin Carey of Education Sector .
State and local shortages are forcing schools to make do with much less .

' The economic situation is hurting school budgets, ' Carey said .
' The stimulus package that just passed will help that somewhat , but there still is n't a whole lot of new money to pay teachers more , reduce class sizes , reduce high school dropout rates. '

Duncan also suggested giving incentives to teachers whose students perform well , an unpopular idea with teachers ' unions .
And he said school systems may need to make tough decisions about teachers who do n't perform at par .

' If teachers are n't making it , we want to support them and help them develop , but ultimately if it 's not working , our children deserve the best, ' Duncan said .
' They probably need to find something else to do. '

Duncan also is pushing for new benchmarks that would use international standards to compare American students with those overseas .

He faults No Child Left Behind for standards that he said do n't accurately monitor some children 's progress .

' When you 're told you 're meeting those standards , you think you 're doing OK. You 're really not, ' Duncan said .

' Our children are not competing for jobs down the block or in the district or in the state -- they 're competing against children in India or China , and they need to know how they stack up. '

Carey said Duncan 's efforts to meet Obama 's education goals are an immensely complicated task .

' There are 50 states , there are 14,000 school districts , 90,000 schools , and Secretary Duncan is responsible for every one of them .
But they all have their own ideas , their own funding sources , their own local leadership, ' Carey said .

Duncan said he feels 'a real sense of urgency ' to implement national education reform .

' Our children in this country have one chance at education .
One chance .
We ca n't wait .
We ca n't wait seven or eight years .
We 'll lose a generation of kids, ' Duncan said .
' And so we have to get better ; we have to get better now. '
