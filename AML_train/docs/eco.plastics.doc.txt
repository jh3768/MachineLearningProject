All about: Recycling plastics - CNN.com
HONG KONG , China ( CNN ) -- Few issues in the environmental movement get people as riled as plastic .

Yet despite what appears to be widespread public outrage at the harmful environmental impacts of plastic bottles and bags in particular -- perhaps the most ubiquitous items in modern day life -- recycling rates have remained fairly stale overall while production levels have in many cases gone up .

Take plastic bags , which , depending on whom you ask , have now reached production levels of anywhere from 500 billion to 5 trillion units a year .
Only 1 percent is recycled globally each year .

Plastic bottles meanwhile are among the most readily recycled plastic products of all , yet in some countries , as much as 90 percent of water bottles end up in landfills .

Despite widespread media coverage presenting plastic bottles as a scourge on the environment , sales of water bottles keep going up .
In 2005 , 43 billion gallons hit worldwide stores ; in 2006 it had risen to 47 billion gallons .

In the U.S. , the world 's biggest consumer market for bottled water , sales hit a record 8.82 billion gallons in 2007 , a 9.5 percent increase from 2005 .
Sales of bottled water in the U.S. have now overtaken sales of milk and are close to outselling beer .

Historically , such increases in sales have run parallel to drops in recycling rates , unfortunately .

Increased production , less recycling

In 1995 , when there was just 1.95 billion pounds of polyethylene terephthalate ( 'PET 1 ' ) bottles in circulation in the U.S. , the country boasted recycling rates of nearly 40 percent .

By 2005 , when retailers were stocking up to 5 billion pounds of PET bottles , recycling rates had dropped to 23 percent .

Sweden however has managed to reach plastic bottle recycling rates of around 80 percent .
So what are countries like the U.S. doing wrong ?

Some blame an immature recycling market in the U.S. for not being able to handle higher volumes of plastic ; a lack of infrastructure has effectively held the market 's development back .

It is certainly a small one -- just one company in Virginia , for example , takes care of recycling duties for around 70 percent of all the plastic bags sent for recycling , but it is not yet a profitable business , losing $ 75 million in 2007 .

Others say increasing production levels are overwhelming consumers .
It 's certainly possible : Americans threw away six times as many water bottles in 2004 as they did in 1997 when there were far fewer in circulation .

Today , despite the fact that 80 percent of American households have access to plastic recycling programs , only around one in four of them take their plastic bottles to the recycling bins .

Why recycle ?

What may not be helping matters is that often people do n't know why they are supposed to be recycling plastic anyway .

In a 2007 national survey of American beliefs about recycling , for example , it was discovered that as much as 72 percent of Americans do n't know that plastic is an oil-based product ( around 10 percent of U.S. oil consumption goes into making plastic ) ; while 40 percent of them think that plastic biodegrades underground , in composts , in landfills , or incredibly , out at sea .

The truth is it does n't biodegrade at all , at least not for up to a thousand years or more .

Compounding the problem is the different types of plastic in circulation at any one time , each needing different recycling treatments .

What essentially makes one type of plastic different from the other is the type of resin used to make it .
The number inside the triangular logo on the sides of plastic containers gives you that information ( many people mistakenly take that logo to mean the product is recyclable -- it does n't ) .

There are around seven different types of plastics in circulation today .
And they do n't always mix .
You ca n't put all plastic bags in the same recycling bin , for example .

Even worse , if you put the 'wrong ' bags in a regular recycling bin , you can be doing more harm than good , as they can 'contaminate ' the stuff that is allowed in those bins during the recycling process .

These 'wrong ' bags are made from low-density polyethylene film , identified as resin code 'LDPE 4 ' which characteristically are the heavier , thicker and more durable plastic bags that clothing stores tend to hand out .
They can be recycled , just not in the same way as the the thinner bags that supermarkets hand out , which are made of high-density polyethylene , and numbered as resin code 'HDPE 2' .
These are more easily recyclable largely because there are more recycling bins that cater for them .

Incentives and bans : the way forward ?

There have been stronger calls for firm government leadership on the issue and for retailers to take proactive action themselves , in the hope that things will get done that much quicker .

The main reason Sweden has such high plastic bottle recycling rates , for example , is largely down to its mandatory nationwide refundable deposit program on PET bottles .

Other countries have joined the trend to ban plastic products instead , particularly plastic bags , which have much lower recycling rates .

China is the latest country to join the small but growing group of nations to implement a ban on plastic bags .
All 'ultra-thin ' bags are banned outright , and from June 1 retailers are banned from issuing free bags .

The country gets through a staggering 3 billion plastic bags a day ; and uses up 37 million barrels of oil a year to make them .

However , the plastics lobby has heavily criticized the growing call to ban plastic bags globally , arguing that it could actually be damaging to the environment to do so .

The American Chemistry Council ( ACC ) , for example , believes that plastic should be repeatedly recycled , arguing that banning plastic bags would simply switch the problem to another material .
According to the ACC paper bags are even more environmentally-damaging and energy-intensive to make than plastic .

As for bottles , it argues that if you replaced plastic with glass to serve up 8 gallons of drink , you would need 27 pounds of glass to do the same job as 2 pounds of plastic .

Other industry groups like the British Retail Consortium ( BRS ) also argue that taxing bags wo n't work either , pointing to the case in Ireland which banned plastic bags in 2002 .
It reduced plastic bag usage by 90 percent in a matter of weeks , but was followed by a 300-500 percent boost in the sales of plastic refuse bags and bin liners , BRS says .

Rising oil prices could mean force recycling

Aside from government intervention , what may force plastics manufacturers to increase the usage of recycled plastic could be rising oil prices .

The plastics industry is heavily dependent on the oil and natural gas industries .

The bottling industry alone now uses up around 100 million barrels of oil a year to produce their product packaging , and that does n't include the fuel used to transport them around the world .

One of the industries driving demand are automakers , which , in a twist of irony are seeking plastic components out in a bid to be more environmentally-friendly .

According to the UK 's Waste &amp ; Resources Action Program , known as WRAP , more automakers are using plastic components in their cars because it makes them lighter and more fuel-efficient .

With automakers , among other industries , using more plastics , many believe demand for plastic is going to keep going up , which wo n't help recycling initiatives .
