CNN.com readers: Are we safe on campus? - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- If a shooter came into some of the biggest classrooms at the University of California-Berkeley , recent graduate Scott Alto wonders whether students would be able to protect themselves .

Alto said some of the big lecture room doors do n't have locks and others open out to the hallway on the Berkeley campus , something he thinks leaves students on campus vulnerable to an attack .

' Students at Virginia Tech said they barricaded themselves with their bodies, ' Alto said .
' In some of these rooms at Berkeley , that just would n't be possible. '

After the shooting at Northern Illinois University last week , students on campuses across the country are wondering whether they are safe .

Some students say they want the administration to install security features such as extra cameras and metal detectors .
Others are calling on them to fix broken blue emergency lights .

Some students , professors and campus police officers argue a person determined to kill can not be stopped , but say they are doing everything they can to put a proper security system in place .

The following is a sample of e-mails sent from CNN.com readers , some of which have been edited for length or clarity :

Liann Casey of Miami , Florida , Florida International University Although my school 's campus has its own police , I hardly see them and I feel like there is no quick way to access them in an emergency situation .
At my old school , University of Miami , they have 'blue light ' poles distributed all throughout the campus with emergency phones directly linked to the campus police .
They claim that the police will be there within minutes of your call .
At orientations and events , the campus police regularly set up a table to promote campus safety and gave away pens with emergency numbers on them .
Help never seemed far away .
My current school , Florida International University , does not yet have any of these safety implementations and my nerves suffer for it .

Scott Alto of Berkeley , California , University of California , Berkeley I am a recent graduate of the University of California , Berkeley .
If a shooter were to come on campus there are very few classrooms with inside locking doors .

Our instruction system requires so many different instructors bouncing around to different classrooms that the campus can not issue keys to them .
This means they can not lock doors in a situation that should result in a lockdown .
Many doors open out into the hallway , preventing any chance of blocking a door with furniture if a shooter were to come onto campus .

Bryan Hernandez of Champaign , Illinois , University of Illinois Champaign-Urbana I work for the University of Illinois Champaign-Urbana police department as a Student Patrol Officer .
I see first hand that the men and women there are outstanding officers who show me respect and professionalism when it comes to their jobs .
They are constantly training for situations involving school buildings where shooters might be located , and always have a presence on campus .
Officers are even stationed in the Union on weekends to ensure the safety of those leaving late or enjoying a quiet night .

Brandon Ackerman of Boca Raton , Florida , Lynn University I go to a small private college in Boca Raton , Florida , and I feel campus safety is a No .
1 concern for students these days .
Our school instituted a program for students who feel if their peers or fellow classmates are showing any behavior that is out of the ordinary or seem depressed or not acting like themselves , they can be reported anonymously to campus safety and the school will seek counseling sessions for them .

Alex Franks of Cheney , Washington , Eastern Washington University I attend Eastern Washington University , where our campus police take good care of us .
They have put in place an e-mail/SMS ( text messaging ) system to alert students instantly if anything is amiss .
Family of students can also sign up for the service to be informed as well .
I feel incredibly safe on campus because of this system -- I think this is the only practical way to keep in touch with students during our busy days , and I can only hope we will never have to use it beyond announcing snow days .

Elizabeth Fitzgerald of Boulder , Colorado , University of Colorado-Boulder The whole 'blue light ' system is a joke here .
Blue lights with buttons on them to dispense the authorities to the area are 'strategically ' planted around campus for students to utilize in an emergency .
The locations are insane .
Most of the time they are in a place in which an attack would probably never happen because it is off a major campus road or by major dorms ... places where there are always people at all hours of the night .
In the legitimate 'dark corners ' of campus , you find a blue light once in a blue moon .
It 's better than nothing ... but it 's such a weak attempt at security .

Laura Antonuccio of Lincoln , Nebraska , University of Nebraska-Lincoln Our university recently put an emergency alert system into effect that provides students with the option of receiving texts , phone calls , e-mails , faxes , etc. in the event of an emergency ; this is definitely a step in the right direction toward helping students feel secure .

There are also several preventive measures that schools and communities can implement ; for example , setting up anonymous tip lines for individuals to call if they fear someone they know may be planning something of this nature .

Joseph Riedel of Washington , American University I attend American University in Washington , D.C. I generally feel pretty safe on our campus .
Our school has taken some pretty aggressive measures in recent years , such as installing emergency call boxes around campus , live monitoring surveillance cameras in parking lots , and frequent security checks around campus at night .

After Virginia Tech , our university also revamped and added emergency strategies , such as text messages in cases of emergency , quick lockdown procedures , and increased security at the front desks of all dormitories .
