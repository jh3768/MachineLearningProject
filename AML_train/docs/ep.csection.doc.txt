Five ways to avoid a C-section  - CNN.com
ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) -- When Barbara Stratton of Baltimore , Maryland , looks back at the birth of her son , Charlie , now 7 , she 's angry -- angry she had a surgery she believes she did n't need .

Stratton said her obstetrician induced labor a week before her due date because she feared the baby would be too large to deliver if they waited for Stratton to go into labor spontaneously .
But even after being induced , her labor still did n't progress , and Stratton ended up with a Caesarean section .
Her baby weighed 8 pounds , 7 ounces -- far smaller than the obstetrician had predicted .

' I never needed the C-section in the first place, ' said Stratton .

The U.S. government and many obstetrical experts are working hard to reduce the number of women having C-sections .
In 2004 , 29 percent of babies in the U.S. were born by C-section , an increase of more than 40 percent since 1996 .
Since it 's major surgery , C-sections involve risks to the mother , including infections , bleeding , and pain .
Babies born via C-sections have more breathing problems right after birth , according to the Office on Women 's Health at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services .

Many experts think as many as half of all C-sections are unnecessary , the women 's health office said .

Stratton said that because of surgical complications she was in pain every day for a year and a half after her son was born .
She became depressed .

' I was in pain every time I rolled over , every time I got out of bed , every time I got out of a chair, ' Stratton said .
' It affected the quality of my mothering .
I had trouble bonding with my son. '

Here 's how to avoid having a C-section unless you absolutely need it -- in such medical emergencies as umbilical cord prolapse , which cuts off the baby 's oxygen , or placenta previa , when the placenta blocks the cervix so that the baby ca n't be born naturally .

Do n't get induced unless medically necessary

Years of study have shown that inducing labor often leads to a C-section .

' If you decide to have an induction because your obstetrician is going out of town , or because your husband is going out of town , that may seem like a bona fide reason , but you 'll pay the price with an increased rate in C-sections, ' said Dr. Michael Klein , emeritus professor of family practice and pediatrics at the University of British Columbia , who 's studied C-sections .

Klein says studies of first-time moms show that 44 percent of those who are induced end up with a C-section but that only 8 percent of those who go into labor spontaneously end up with a C-section .
Doctors say many times , inducing women way before the cervix is ready can lead to unproductive labor , which then necessitates a C-section .

Labor at home until you 're approximately 3 centimeters dilated

Dr. Elliott Main , director of obstetric quality at Sutter Health in California , said encouraging moms to stay at home in early labor is one way his hospital has been able to keep C-section rates steady while nationally the rate keeps climbing every year .

Why would laboring at home help fend off a C-section ?

Part of it has to do with the way mothers feel .
' Anxiety can slow down labor, ' he said .
' And nobody likes being in a hospital .
It 's a strange room and there are lots of strange people and some of them are coming at you with needles. '

Hospitals themselves are often to blame , he said .
Too often medical staffs intervene unnecessarily in early laboring with pain medications , monitors , and other techniques , which can slow labor down , according to Main .
' Even in the best-meaning hospitals , these kinds of practices happen, ' Main said .

At Sutter hospitals , 'We say it 's totally fine to come in and be checked , but that you should understand why it may be safer for you to be at home for a while, ' he said .

Choose your hospital , and your practitioner , carefully

If having a vaginal birth is important to you , shop for a doctor and a hospital with low C-section rates .
' Let 's say one hospital has an 18 percent C-section rate , and another one is 45 percent .
Which door you walk into will have a profound effect on what happens to you, ' said Carol Sakala , director of programs at Childbirth Connection , a nonprofit group .
You can find out the rates by checking with the doctor 's office and the hospital .

In the delivery room , ask questions if your practitioner says you need a C-section

Some situations are true emergencies , and a C-section is necessary within minutes to save the baby 's life .
' That 's not a time to negotiate, ' said Dr. Timothy R.B .
Johnson , chair of obstetrics at the University of Michigan .

But in other situations , parents should ask questions about whether a C-section is absolutely necessary , he says .
For example , if a doctor says the baby is too big to deliver vaginally , 'There 's a conversation to be had .
You can ask , 'Doctor , are you sure the baby 's too big ?
How big ?
' ' Johnson said .
' Our ability to guess size is not absolute .
I 've had babies I thought were 11 pounds that turned out to be 7 pounds .
Doctors get humbled on a regular basis. '

Get a doula

After her own disappointing birth experience , Barbara Stratton became a doula .
Doulas , or birth assistants , can help advocate for a mother when she 's in labor .
