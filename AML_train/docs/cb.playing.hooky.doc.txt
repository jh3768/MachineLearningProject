One-third of workers play hooky - CNN.com
If you decided to stay home from work today because your psychic told you to , would you tell your boss the truth or make up an excuse ?

One employee faced with this dilemma told her boss the truth , but CareerBuilder.com 's annual survey on absenteeism shows that many of us would n't .
Thirty-three percent of employees played hooky last year and , rather than come clean with their bosses , they pretended to be sick .

Just not wanting to go to work that day was enough to keep 34 percent of workers from showing up this year .
Although most truant workers lacked the motivation to go to work , some were avoiding the headaches awaiting them at the office .
Nine percent of workers who played hooky wanted to skip a meeting , spend time working on an overdue project or avoid the wrath of a boss or colleague .

Another common reason employees skipped work was because they had other things to do .
Thirty percent of workers needed to relax and recharge , and 22 percent caught up on their sleep .
Medical appointments , personal errands and quality time with friends and family were also good enough reasons to feign illness .

If you do decide to call in sick when you 're not , be prepared to sell your story with sniffles and a throaty cough ; 18 percent of employers have fired workers who missed work without a legitimate reason .
Thirty-one percent of employers checked up on an employee who called in sick .
Of those employers who did check , 71 percent required a doctor 's note .
Fifty-six percent called the employee at home , while 18 percent asked another worker to call the employee at home and 17 percent drove by the employee 's home .

As tempted as you may be to weave an elaborate yarn explaining your absence , the truth is your smartest route .
If you 're honest with your boss , you do n't have to worry about a slip of the tongue or an unexpected run-in with the boss foiling your alibi .

Plus , employers have grown flexible in terms of what constitutes a sick day , as 65 percent of them consider the need to take a mental health day a valid reason to take time off .
Therefore , the need to take a personal day no longer has the stigma it once did .
