Alcatel-Lucent chairman, CEO to resign  - CNN.com
PARIS , France ( AP ) -- The chairman and CEO of French telecommunications giant Alcatel-Lucent will both resign later this year , the company said Tuesday .

The announcement of the departures of Chairman Serge Tchuruk and Chief Executive Patricia Russo came as the world 's largest fixed and mobile telecom gear maker reported its sixth consecutive quarter of losses .

Tchuruk will step down Oct. 1 , and Russo will resign 'no later than the end of the year, ' the company said in a statement , adding that the search for replacements is to begin immediately .

Alcatel-Lucent reported a net loss of euro1.1 billion ( $ 1.73 billion ) for the second quarter after taking a euro810 million ( $ 1.3 billion ) goodwill writedown , compared to a net loss of euro586 million a year earlier .

The company , which was formed through the 2006 merger of France 's Alcatel and the U.S.-based Lucent , is in the middle of a painful restructuring that foresees 16,500 job cuts .

In its statement , the company quoted Tchuruk , Alcatel 's longtime chairman and CEO before the merger saw him take on the non-executive chairman role , as saying the resignations were aimed at giving Alcatel-Lucent 'a personality of its own , independent from its two predecessors. '

Russo was quoted as saying that although she was 'pleased ' with the company 's progress , 'the company will benefit from new leadership ... to bring a fresh and independent perspective. '

When conceived , the Alcatel-Lucent merger was designed to boost margins through cost and research and development savings , while improving the joint company 's pricing power with telecom operators , its largest customers .

But intense competition in the industry means many of the savings have been used on discounts passed on to customers .
