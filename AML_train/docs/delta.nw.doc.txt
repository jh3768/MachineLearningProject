Delta, Northwest approve merger - CNN.com
ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) -- The directors of Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines reached agreement on a merger deal that -- if approved -- would create the world 's largest airline .

The Atlanta-based combined airline will have $ 17.7 billion enterprise value , according to the statement on Monday .
Delta CEO Richard Anderson will head the merged carrier , which will retain the Delta name .

Both airlines emerged from bankruptcy protection last year .

Delta also announced on Monday it reached an agreement with its pilot union to extend the existing collective bargaining agreement through the end of 2012 .
The agreement , subject to a vote by the pilots , provides Delta pilots a 3.5 percent equity stake in the new company and other enhancements to the current contract .

Officials said the new airline would provide employees great job security and stability in the face of rising fuel costs and competition .

Customers also stand to benefit from the merger with competitive fares and more flight choices , officials said .

' We said we would only enter into a consolidation transaction it is was right for all of our constituencies, ' Anderson said in a statement .
' Delta and Northwest are a perfect fit. '

Northwest CEO Doug Steenland said the combined airline 'will be able to overcome the industry 's boom-and-bust cycles. '

But Northwest 's pilots ' union quickly announced that it opposed the proposed merger , complaining that Delta and its pilots ' union had come to their agreement without input from the Northwest pilots .

' This agreement clearly disadvantages NWA pilots both with respect to economic issues and seniority list integration, ' said union chairman Dave Stevens .
' A merger built on this unstable foundation is likely to put the combined airline in a position similar to that of US Airways .

Stevens said that such a labor relations scenario would combine with current economic problems -- including the rising price of oil -- 'to place the Northwest pilots and all other Northwest employees at greater risk than as a stand-alone carrier. '

Combined , the airline and its regional partners will offer flights to nearly 400 destinations in 67 countries .

Officials say they expect to generate more than $ 1 billion in annual revenue through more effective use of aircraft , a comprehensive and diversified route system , reduced overhead and improved operational efficiency .

Front-line employees of Delta and Northwest will be provided seniority protection , and U.S.-based non-pilot employees of both companies would be provided a 4 percent equity stake in the new airline upon closing .

Company officials said they expect no involuntary furloughs of front-line employees as a result of the merger and that the existing pension plans for employees from both companies would be protected .
Front-line employees include flight attendants , baggage handlers and others who deal directly with the public .

No hub closures are expected to result from the merger .

Last month , Delta offered voluntary retirement and buyout packages to about 30,000 employees and is slashing domestic capacity by an extra 5 percent this year to deal with record high fuel costs and a weakening U.S. economy .

The airline announced plans to cut 2,000 front-line , administrative and management positions through attrition , retirement and limited hiring .

Employees can apply for the retirement and buyout packages , which wo n't be offered to pilots , between April 14 and May 12 , according to a memo sent in March .
