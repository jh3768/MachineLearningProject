Make the most of being jobless!  - CNN.com
When Martin P. * was laid off from his job as a marketing vice president , he embarked on a two-year job search and still came up short .

Brian Smith recently experienced a 51-week lapse between steady employments .
Lisa Wetherby was out of work 17 long months before finding full-time work and Domenick DeMarco has been unemployed for 10 months to date .

That 's a long time to be out of work .
So what exactly does one do during that time off ?

' Do something , anything , especially something new or something [ you 've ] not had time to do in the past, ' urges Laura George , author of 'Excuse Me , Your Job is Waiting .
' 'Doing something enjoyable gets brain cells firing , creates a new paradigm , brings in new people and improves morale and overall well-being. '

What you do n't do is treat your unemployment as a vacation .

' In the big picture , it 's critical that you do n't utilize your flexible time circumstances to procure a coach potato license, ' says Nicholas Nigro , author of 'No Job ?
No Prob !
' 'You 've got to be active -- both physically and mentally -- to apply your ample free time to the best of your advantage. '

It 's hard , however , for job seekers to use anything to their advantage , especially when the bleak economy makes them feel like they 're up against the world -- or at least millions of other people .

Competition in the work force is fiercer than ever before , with 9.5 million jobless people in the United States and only 3.3 million job openings at the end of August 2008 , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics .

Despite these grim facts , there is light at the end of the proverbial unemployment tunnel .

' No one can dispute that the absence of a job and a corresponding income stream is a potentially alarming scenario, ' Nigro says .
' If you firmly believe that your current joblessness is merely a glitch in your abiding life expedition , your new outlook will noticeably brighten. '

So desolate job seekers , the good news is that even with these tough times , things will get better and you will survive .
Here 's how you can make the most of your unemployment :

Step No .
1 : Take care of logistics .
When you 're laid off , there are several unpleasant -- albeit necessary -- issues to tackle .
Before anything else , apply for unemployment benefits , resolve severance concerns , figure out your health-care coverage and assess your financial situation .

Step No .
2 : Mourn .
Job loss is devastating .
In fact , after the death of someone close to you and divorce , it 's one of the biggest losses you suffer .
Not only have you lost your job ; you 've lost routine , money , pride and perhaps most importantly , a sense of purpose .

Understandably , a little moping is allowed , says Jodi R. R. Smith , president of Mannersmith , an etiquette consulting firm .
A week of bad daytime TV and junk food is about right ; then it 's time to dust off and find some balance , she says .

Step No .
3 : Make good use of your time .
With eight extra hours in your day and not much coming up in your job search , there are countless things you can do to improve yourself , personally and professionally .
Here are some ideas :

& # 8226 ; Create your own jobs .
Suddenly being jobless throws a lot of people into a schedule-free day , says Lynette Radio .
As consultants who are sometimes between assignments , she and her husband tackle projects around the house like painting or putting in new floors .

' It keeps us busy and on a schedule, ' she says .
' Structure is what you need most at this point to not only feel professional , but not fall into a cycle of self-pity. '

& # 8226 ; Do n't limit yourself .
If you ca n't get a job in the industry you want , find a creative way to be a provider -- not just a worker -- in the industry you 're interested in , says Vicki Kunkel , author of 'Instant Appeal : The 8 Primal Factors That Create Blockbuster Success. '

' Do n't limit yourself to finding a job in the industry you 've worked in for the past 15 or 20 years .
A layoff is a good time to look at what really matters to you , what you love to do or what you 've always wanted to try. '

& # 8226 ; Reassess your life .
Joblessness allows you to reconsider your work situation , as well as other aspects of your life .

' Ironically , unemployment also provides time to truly get it right in terms of work/life balance, ' says Paula Santonocito , a business journalist specializing in employment issues .
' There are no more excuses for avoiding an exercise routine or getting enough sleep. '

Such positive lifestyle habits have a positive impact on your job search , she says .

& # 8226 ; Learn a new language .
Spend 30 minutes every day learning a foreign language , suggests Jill Keto , author of 'Do n't Get Caught with Your Skirt Down : A Practical Girl 's Recession Guide. '

' Job skills of people with U.S. experience are in high demand in emerging economies around the world, ' Keto says .
With a foreign language under your belt , you 'll be in an excellent position to climb the ranks when the U.S. economy rebounds .

& # 8226 ; Look for an internship .
If you 're interested in a career transition , an internship allows you to learn from a company in a different industry .

' Make yourself available for a learning opportunity , at a cut rate to the employer, ' says Lauren Milligan , founder of consulting firm ResuMAYDAY.com .
' Seeking out this nontraditional type of situation will show initiative and confidence .
' And , if you do a great job , you 'll be on the short list for a full-time position .

& # 8226 ; Network , network , network .
Always look for new ways to expand your network and utilize the one you already have .
You can do so by getting involved with relevant professional associations , says Colette Ellis , a career and stress management coach for InStep Consulting .

' Find opportunities to take on leadership roles to increase your visibility within the industry, ' she says .
You can also join committees that are working on strategic projects for the association .

& # 8226 ; Re-invent yourself .
Reinvention is simply re-examining yourself , taking what you 've learned over time and evaluating what makes you tick , says Sean Simpson , communications director for Express Employment Professionals .

' Reconnect with what gets you excited, ' he says .
' Once you have figured out what your passions are , match them to your skills and experience you have gained over the years .
This will help you determine what jobs best utilize your strengths and which choices are most suitable for you. '

& # 8226 ; Set up a buddy system .
' Find a friend , former colleague or a neighbor-someone with a positive attitude that you can chat with regularly to keep you going, ' says Cheri Paulson , senior vice president and director of operations with Keystone Associates , a career management company .
' Set up small groups for support but make sure that it is an encouraging tone because you do n't need to be around negative people. '

& # 8226 ; Take a class .
Is there a skill that you lack or that might have previously held you back from advancement opportunities ?
In your free time , take a class that leads to professional credentials or technical proficiencies , Milligan says .
It 's an easy way to beef up your r&eacute ; sum&eacute ; and make yourself more marketable .

& # 8226 ; Volunteer .
Eighty-one percent of employers view volunteering as relevant work experience , according to a recent CareerBuilder.com survey .
Roxanne Ravenel , a job-search coach , says volunteering gives people a sense of purpose and empowerment , which is critical to the self-esteem of job hunters who feel powerless after weeks or months of a fruitless job search .

' Volunteering gives job hunters the opportunity to meet decision-makers in their community to which they would n't otherwise have access, ' Ravenel says .
Decision-makers get to see the job seeker in action , which helps them envision working with that person full time .
