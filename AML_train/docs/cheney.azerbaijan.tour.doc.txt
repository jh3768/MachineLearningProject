Cheney: U.S. wants stability for Georgia region - CNN.com
BAKU , Azerbaijan ( CNN ) -- Vice President Dick Cheney reiterated U.S. support for Georgia on the opening day of a tour of three former Soviet republics .

In remarks made after meeting the president of Azerbaijan , Cheney said the U.S. had an abiding interest in the region 's stability .

During the trip , which also takes in Ukraine and Georgia , high on the agenda will be the conflict between Georgia and Russia , and Moscow 's subsequent recognition of two breakaway Georgian provinces as independent .

Cheney said Wednesday , 'One of the basic foundations of security and peace is respect for national borders , a principle that is endangered today .

' Although we decided on this visit months ago , we met this evening in the shadow of the recent Russian invasion of Georgia , an act that has been clearly condemned by the international community .

' President Bush has sent me here with a clear and simple message to the people of Azerbaijan and the entire region : The United States has deep and abiding interests in your well-being and security. '

Cheney 's trip began as U.S. government sources confirmed the Bush administration plans for a $ 1 billion aid package for Georgia .

Azerbaijan , which borders Georgia and Iran and sits along the Caspian Sea , is an oil- and gas-rich nation and a key U.S. ally in the region .

Cheney held meetings Wednesday afternoon with Azerbaijan representatives of BP and Chevron before meeting President Ilham Aliyev .

They briefed Cheney on their assessments of the energy situation in the country and the broader Caspian region , especially in light of Russia 's recent military actions in neighboring Georgia , the White House said .
They also described their activities , the region 's significant energy potential and some of the challenges they face , the White House said .

A senior U.S. administration official said last week that the two will discuss recent events neighboring Georgia , along with Azerbaijan 's cooperation in the war on terrorism and its troop contributions in Iraq and Afghanistan .

The United States wants to ensure a diversity of energy supplies and supply routes to Europe , the administration official said , and countries like Azerbaijan are key to developing additional resources .

The official said the recent conflict with Russia means the United States and Europe are even more interested in diversifying energy infrastructure , pipelines and supplies to lessen Europe 's reliance on Russia as an energy provider .

' The level of confidence and trust that people have in Russia 's overall reliability has been put in serious question by what 's happened, ' the official said , 'and I would assume that extends to energy and the issue of energy supplies. '

After Azerbaijan , Cheney plans to visit Georgia , where he is expected to meet President Mikheil Saakashvili and discuss the conflict with Russia .
Cheney will also assess the U.S. and international relief operations after the fighting .

Cheney will be the highest-level U.S. official to visit Georgia since the crisis between Georgia and Russia began .

' I 'm sure that the vice president and President Saakashvili will also look beyond the immediate situation and discuss in depth the need for a comprehensive long-term strategy by the international community to help Georgia recover and rebuild , including the critical task of supporting the democratic choice of the Georgian people to integrate further with Euro-Atlantic institutions , including NATO, ' the administration official said .

The Georgia-Russia conflict and NATO will also be a major topic when Cheney visits Ukraine on Friday , the official said .

Cheney finishes the trip in Italy where he plans to address the annual Ambrosetti Forum on Lake Como , giving a speech on challenges facing the trans-Atlantic alliance .
He then plans to meet both Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and President Giorgio Napolitano .

The trip will be Cheney 's first to Azerbaijan and Georgia , and his first to Ukraine since he became vice president , his office said .
