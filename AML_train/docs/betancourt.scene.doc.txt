Betancourt: Rescue is a 'miracle' - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- Former presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt has described her rescue from leftist rebels as 'a miracle ' and 'a moment of pride ' in Colombia .

Fifteen hostages held by Colombian rebels -- including Betancourt and three Americans -- were freed Wednesday without a shot being fired in an elaborately planned rescue , government officials said .

Wearing a camouflage vest and hat and appearing healthy after being held hostage for more than six years in the jungle , Betancourt stepped onto the tarmac from a Colombian military jet in Bogota and hugged her mother and husband , smiling broadly .

' Well , let 's see if I can speak because I am very , very moved, ' she said .

' To the Virgin Mary , I prayed a lot .
I imagined this moment very often , with my mom. '

Then , she addressed her mother directly .

' You do n't have to cry any more, ' she said .

Betancourt then kneeled on the tarmac along with her fellow former captives , prayed and received a blessing from a Catholic priest .

The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia kidnapped the former senator and aggressive reformer in February 2002 while she was campaigning in a remote southern area of the country .
She was an outspoken campaigner against corruption and the drug trade in her country .

Her release was greeted with an outpouring of joy in France , politicians and media praising a woman who had become a cause celebre in the country where she grew up .

On Wednesday she appeared in good health despite reports that she had suffered chronic liver problems for years while in captivity .

She walked from the plane on her own and remained standing for more than an hour as she recounted her rescue and answered questions from reporters .

She paused to remember other hostages who never made it home and called on FARC to release all remaining prisoners .

' This moment of happiness will not help us forget that it was a miracle -- that others died, ' she said .
' The peace has to come with the commitment that there will be no more kidnapping. '

She also asked rebel leaders for mercy for a more unlikely group -- the guards holding her captive when she was rescued .

' We left them alive and God willing they will remain alive because I hope they will not be held accountable by the FARC, ' Betancourt said .
' It was not their fault .
The operation was perfect. '

In the elaborately planned ruse , Colombian military arrived in white helicopters posing as rebels intended to transfer the hostages to another location .

Betancourt thanked Colombian President Alvaro Uribe , who 'knew exactly how to play his cards well for us .
' Still , she said she still dreams of one day serving as Colombia 's president .

One of the recently released hostages appeared to have a coatimundi -- an animal related to the raccoon common in the jungles of South and Central America -- on a leash on his shoulder .

Meanwhile , Betancourt 's family celebrated a day they sometimes feared would never come .

Melanie Delloye , her daughter , stood beside French President Nicolas Sarkozy in Paris , thanking everyone who supported Betancourt before boarding a plane to meet with her mother .

' We just want to hold mom in our arms, ' she said .
' You 've allowed us to begin living the most beautiful moment of our life. '

Betancourt attended school in France and also holds French citizenship .

' There were a lot of deceptions , but they always believed and they always had confidence, ' Sarkozy said .
' There is always a small glimmer of hope and today the joy is huge .
All of France is happy to welcome back Ingrid Betancourt. '
