UK government takes stake in three banks - CNN.com
LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- The British government on Monday said it would make a multi-billion investment in three of the country 's major banks to help them through the 'first financial crisis of the global age. '

The Treasury will pump $ 63 billion into the Royal Bank of Scotland , HBOS and Lloyds TSB .

' It is not just important to economists and financial experts .
It 's something that matters for every family and business in Britain, ' British Prime Minister Gordon Brown explained at a Monday news conference .

' In extraordinary times , with financial markets ceasing to work , the government can not just leave people on their own to be buffeted about .
For savers , for small businesses and for homeowners , we must in an uncertain and unstable world , be the rock of stability upon which British people can depend. '

The banks have been battered in the global financial meltdown and the influx of funds is designed to stabilize their positions and boost the country 's long-term economic outlook , the Treasury said .

Brown predicted other governments across Europe and the United States would take similar action to support banks in the coming days .

' This is the perhaps the first government to do what I believe a large number of governments are going to do over the next few days and it is about restoring trust and confidence in the banking system , which is absolutely essential for a banking system to flourish. '

A fourth bank , Barclays , said it would forego the government program and raise $ 11 billion on its own , by selling new shares of preferred stock .

The government plan to back the banks was announced last week .

Asked if there is 'a plan B ' should this action not resolve the crisis , Brown said : 'We will do whatever it takes to deal with this problem. '

Brown said the global economy required a global framework for supervision .

' This is the first financial crisis of the global age, ' according to Brown .

' The prospects for the global economy over the next 20 years are very strong indeed, ' he suggested .
' The world economy will double in size over the next 20 years. '
