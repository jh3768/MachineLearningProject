Lawlessness turns Baquba into ghost town - CNN.com
BAQUBA , Iraq ( CNN ) -- 'Watch out for snipers, ' one of the soldiers said as I stepped out of the back of a Bradley fighting vehicle and stared at the deserted street .

Shops were shuttered , and mountains of trash were piled everywhere .
I felt a wave of shock .

When I had walked these streets less than a year ago , the air was filled with the buzz of shoppers , vendors screaming prices and blaring car horns .
Rows of stalls were filled with everything from fruits and vegetables to women 's lingerie , electronic equipment and music .
It was a bustling marketplace .

But now , everything is different in this city of 300,000 .
Baquba is a virtual ghost town where most residents stay inside most of the day for fear of being kidnapped and tortured or killed .

As I toured the area , down one of the alleys , there was a cluster of people .

' It 's been like this for about four months now .
Everything just shuts down after 11 [ a.m. ] because that 's when they come and they kidnap and murder, ' one Iraqi said .

' But I ca n't tell you who they are .
They will kill me .
No one can say who they are. '

' They ' are extremist groups -- Sunni and Shia -- and criminal gangs .

At a minimum , it costs $ 10,000 to buy freedom from the kidnappers , and that 's still no guarantee they wo n't kill you .

I pressed on .
Four women peered down from a balcony and waved , a man rode by on a bicycle , and an empty bus rumbled down the street .

Baquba is the provincial capital of Diyala , an ethnic microcosm of Iraq .
It is plagued with a variety of Sunni insurgents , Shiite militias and al Qaeda in Iraq terrorists .

It was always volatile -- one of the so-called 'trouble spots ' -- yet it still had a local government that functioned .
It also had some of the better trained Iraqi Security Forces .

But it was a city that was always on the edge .

At the main police headquarters , where in December 2005 CNN 's Anderson Cooper broadcast his show from the roof , we could n't even go as far as the outdoor stairs .

Inside , the Iraqi police -- none of whom would speak on camera -- told a story of deteriorating security and a corrupt chief of police who was fired , but only after too much damage was done .
They pointed out the pictures of policemen who had been slaughtered by the insurgents .

They all blamed al Qaeda 's increasing influence in the area .

But al Qaeda is just one part of the equation .
It seems as if everything that had been simmering below the surface here has suddenly exploded .

' It 's become a sectarian issue and we are sick of this, ' said Ismail Rashid .
' Why ca n't the Americans secure this ?
They can do anything .
They have eyes in the sky .
They can see everything. '

Rashid 's anger and frustration are palpable .
He has 10 shops here and all of them have been closed for the last six months , he said .

The American troops here are stretched thin .
They are not only physically fighting the various diverse elements of the insurgency , but also a battle of perception .

' Those terrorist groups have begun to take advantage of a perception of unwarranted fear that is now becoming actual fear .
As we try to drive a wedge between the insurgents and the people , the insurgents are trying to drive a wedge between the people and the government, ' said Col. David Sutherland , commander of the Army 's 3rd Brigade , 1st Cavalry Division .

Meanwhile , the provincial government has n't met in at least three months because of the violence , and the Iraqi Security Forces are now viewed by many as operating along sectarian lines .
There 's not much for the people of Baquba to be optimistic about .
