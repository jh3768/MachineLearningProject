Black presidents nothing new to Hollywood - CNN.com
( CNN ) -- Voters will determine if America is ready for a black president come November , but Hollywood , often ahead of the national curve , made up its mind about the issue ages ago .

On television and in film , black actors as acclaimed as James Earl Jones and as obscure as Tommy Lister have played commanders-in-chief .

Sammy Davis Jr. was only 9 when he assumed the top office in the 1933 satire 'Rufus Jones for President .
' The film was as short as its adorable star .

But those 21 minutes were all too long on racial stereotypes .
Chicken , watermelon , dice playing -- funny back then to many .
Now , not so much .

Fast forward a few decades and the notion of a black man in the Oval Office provides ample joke fodder for comics such as Richard Pryor and Chris Rock .

On one episode of 'The Richard Pryor Show, ' the comedian 's short-lived '70s variety hour , he played a president hosting a press conference .
During the sketch , he tells a corps of reporters that he 'd seriously consider Black Panther Huey Newton for the job of FBI director -- and nearly decks one journalist who inadvertently insults his momma .
And when he 's asked about his fetish for white women , he jokes , 'They do n't call it the White House for nothing. '

In the 2003 film 'Head of State, ' Chris Rock 's president , Mays Gilliam , is an even more exaggerated caricature .
His populist talk is glazed with hip-hop slang .
Gilliam , a community organizer , is also partial to baggy jeans and Kangol caps and looks less like the leader of the free world than the latest signing of Def Jam Records .
His running mate , played by Bernie Mac , thinks NATO is a person and not an acronym .

Gilliam is catapulted onto the public stage after the sitting president dies in a plane crash .
It is not the first time a black man on screen has risen to power amidst calamity .

In 'The Man, ' James Earl Jones receives the big gig after the entire cabinet perishes in a series of freak accidents .
In 'Deep Impact, ' Morgan Freeman has to calm the nation as he contends with wayward comets threatening to destroy the planet .
And in 'The Fifth Element, ' set in 2263 , Tommy Lister 's President Lindberg has to battle asteroids and an enemy appropriately named The Great Evil .

It 's not until the hit series '24 ' that things start looking up for the black president .
Dennis Haysbert 's character , David Palmer -- in the first season a senator running for the presidency -- is handsome , composed and ready to lead on Day One .
His race is a non-issue as he grapples with modern-day threats such as terrorism , bomb scares and a social-climbing wife .

Yes , he 's eventually assassinated , but only after he leaves office .
And Palmer 's equally self-possessed younger brother , Wayne , takes the reins shortly thereafter .

Will these depictions make any difference to Barack Obama 's candidacy ?
Who knows ?
But what was once the stuff of joke and fantasy could be months away from being the real thing .
