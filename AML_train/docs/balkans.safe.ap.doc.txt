U.N.: Balkans 'one of safest' parts of Europe - CNN.com
BELGRADE , Serbia ( AP ) -- A United Nations report released Thursday says the Balkans , a region once known as a hotbed of crime and violence , has become one of the safest zones in Europe .

' The vicious circle of political instability leading to crime , and vice versa , that plagued the Balkans in the 1990s has been broken, ' said Antonio Maria Costa , head of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime , which compiled the report .

However , Costa warned in the report 's summary that the region remains vulnerable because of enduring connections between business , politics and organized crime .

The region includes 10 countries : Albania , Bosnia , Croatia , Macedonia , Moldova , Bulgaria , Romania , Montenegro , Serbia and Kosovo , which declared independence from Serbia in January .

The bloody breakup of former Yugoslavia -- the worst carnage in Europe since World War II -- left the entire region in turmoil throughout the 1990s .

The report says that the levels of crime against people and property , like homicide , robbery , rape , burglary and assault , are now lower in the Balkans than in Western Europe .

' The Balkans is departing from an era when demagogues , secret police and thugs profited from sanctions busting , and the smuggling of people , arms , cigarettes and drugs, ' the report says , in an apparent reference to the former Yugoslavia during the warmongering rule of its late autocrat Slobodan Milosevic .

Organized crime is also receding as a major threat , it adds , with smuggling of drugs , guns and humans through the region in decline .

But it notes that the Balkans remain a transit zone for heroin destined for Western Europe .

Some 80 tons of heroin smuggled from the Middle and Far East is believed to reach Western European markets , the report says , adding that 'this flow of contraband is worth more than the national economic outputs of several countries of the region. '

The trend of reduced crime is likely to continue , the report says , because the region lacks the usual factors that lead to crime elsewhere in the world : mass poverty , income inequality , runaway urbanization and large-scale youth unemployment .

However , the UNODC report shows that serious challenges persist , 'particularly due to links between business , politics and crime. '

' Profiteers of the past are trying to launder their reputations and money through business and politics, ' Costa said .
' Future crime trends in the Balkans will depend on the rule of law , integrity in governance and political ability ... politics and business need to be better insulated from the corrosive influence of crime , especially economic crime. '

The report says that 'on average , Southeast Europeans are more likely to face demands for bribes than people in other regions of the world. '

' Open societies , open markets , and open borders are the best way to fight crime in the Balkans, ' Costa said .

He urges countries of the region to strengthen the rule of law , and called on the international community , particularly the European Union , to provide the support needed to further reduce vulnerability to crime and instability in the region .

' While dispelling a few myths and raising the profile of the Balkans as a low-crime region , the main aim of this report is to stimulate the delivery of technical assistance that can further encourage the positive trends and reduce the likelihood of a return to trouble in the Balkans, ' Costa said .
' The highest priority is , of course , Kosovo , where stabilization started later , and where crime remains a problem. '
