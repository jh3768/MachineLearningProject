Mercedes' fish-inspired car - CNN.com
( PopSci.com ) -- When Mercedes-Benz began to contemplate its next generation of high-efficiency small cars , it sought aquatic inspiration .

But instead of considering obvious undersea hot rods like sharks , the Mercedes team turned to a fish that resembled a car : the tropical boxfish .

A native of the Indo-Pacific region , the Ostracion cubicus is surprisingly slick .

Wind-tunnel testing of a clay model revealed a drag coefficient ( Cd ) of just 0.06 , startlingly close to the ideal 0.04 of a water droplet .

Like the droplet , the boxfish 's face is small in proportion to its overall length , and its streamlined surfaces encourage air to move over it without creating the turbulence that robs aerodynamic efficiency .

Mercedes ' Bionic concept vehicle mimics this functional form .

With a Cd of just 0.19 , the four-seat Bionic is significantly more slippery than today 's most aerodynamic production vehicle , Honda 's two-seat Insight ( Cd 0.25 ) .

The design team eschewed expensive , complicated and heavy fuel-cell or hybrid powertrains , opting instead for a 1.9-liter four-cylinder direct-injection turbodiesel that pushes the fishmobile to 62 mph in 8.2 seconds with a combined city/highway fuel economy of 70 mpg .

At a constant 56 mph , the concept car will return an amazing 84 mpg .

Although the Bionic is n't coming to your local dealership , Mercedes does expect it to significantly influence the design language of its next generation of small cars .
