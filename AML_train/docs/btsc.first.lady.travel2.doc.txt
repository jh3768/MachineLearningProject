Day 2 with the first lady: On the run in Senegal - CNN.com
DAKAR , Senegal ( CNN ) -- It 's day two and we are literally on the run .

We 've gathered in a small room inside the Le Meridien President hotel where we 're told to drop our morning coffee and run .

It 's time for a security sweep , and Secret Service agents and their canines wait outside .
We put down our computers , cameras , purses and backpacks in a neat line on the sidewalk , where bomb-sniffing dogs circle our gear .
We grumble and shuffle because we have n't had enough caffeine .

Only one person seems grumpier -- a Senegalese security woman who seems to have lost her patience with us .
She calls us to come quickly so she can wand us for weapons .

We jump into the first motorcade of the day without the first lady .
A white van labeled 'press 1 ' is our ticket to ride , and what a ride it turns into .

The guide leading our entourage is in front of us .
He is a Senegalese police officer on a motorcycle and his job is to get us to Senegal President Abdoulaye Wade 's house as quickly as possible .

With horns blaring , the officer bobs and weaves through traffic .
He points , directs and waves with one hand , and then with two .
Then , frustrated he 's not going through Dakar 's morning rush hour traffic fast enough , he bolts across a dirt median , leading our motorcade down a one-way street -- the wrong way .

We are in awe and terror as we speed into oncoming traffic .
Buses packed with people and trucks loaded with cement barrel toward us .
Herds of goats scatter .
Our Senegalese motor cop gestures wildly for vehicles to get out of the way .

With every speed bump we hit , the two passengers in the back of our van go flying into the air and then come slamming back down into their seats .
' Ahhhhhhh ! ' they scream .
A small car careens onto the roadside .
I can see the whites of the driver 's eyes .
She 's a smartly dressed woman in a red business suit who looks absolutely stunned .

' Did you see her face ?
' I ask the colleague next to me .

We pull up to the gates of the president 's home and our motor cop jumps off his bike .
The two guards standing at the gate refuse to let us in .
Two U.S. diplomats jump out of our caravan , as well as a 5-foot female White House volunteer who all of a sudden seems to be much bigger .
The small scrum of Senegalese and American officials begin the delicate dance of negotiating our entrance .
As it turns out , we are at the wrong gate of the Senegalese White House .

We end up making the first lady 's event on time , by doing what we had done first thing in the morning -- running !
