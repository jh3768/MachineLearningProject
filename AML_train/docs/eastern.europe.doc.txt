Eastern Europe: What's now - CNN.com
( Tribune Media Services ) -- Forget lists of 'What 's Next ' in travel .
Eastern Europe is 'What 's Now .
' While it 's catching up to the West -- becoming more modern , expensive and crowded -- Eastern Europe remains a great value .
Here 's what to expect this year .

Throughout Europe , treaties determine who must show a passport at which borders .
Eastern Europe is following Western Europe 's lead by opening things up .
The Czech Republic , Slovakia , Poland , Hungary , Slovenia and the Baltic countries -- but not Croatia -- just joined the Schengen Agreement for land and sea borders ( it applies to airports beginning in March ) .
That means you can freely pass between these countries , and existing Schengen countries ( such as Germany , Austria and Italy ) , without stopping at any borders .
Passport stamps will become even more rare , and you 'll get a better night 's sleep on international overnight trains .

Croatia and Slovenia

In Split , the harborfront promenade called the Riva has been completely overhauled .
The cafe umbrellas , concrete and patchwork landscaping were replaced by a broad , sleek , bright-white public space .
While some people enjoy this snazzy and slick people zone , many locals think it clashes with the higgledy-piggledy Old Town .

Croatia 's top destination , Dubrovnik , is being re-discovered , including by cruise ship crowds .
On a very busy day in summer , as many as 30,000 passengers -- seven giant ships ' worth -- inundate the little Old Town .
Non-cruise travelers should do their sightseeing , especially walking around the City Wall , early or late to avoid the midday crush and heat .

The Nona Ana catamaran , which swiftly connects Dubrovnik to Mljet Island ( with its national park ) , has extended its run .
In the summer , it now also continues four times each week to the ever-popular island town of Korcula .

In Ljubljana , a new funicular effortlessly zips visitors up from the riverside market to the castle above town .
The city 's airport , which already had two names ( 'Ljubljana Airport ' and 'Brnik Airport, ' for a nearby village ) , was recently given a controversial third moniker : Joze Pucnik Airport .
The recently deceased Pucnik was one of many politicians instrumental in Slovenian independence in the 1990s .

Poland

Krakow is changing fast , including an ongoing transformation of Oskar Schindler 's old factory ( near the Kazimierz Jewish quarter ) into a museum .
The main office building will host an exhibit about the non-Jews who aided Holocaust victims , while the old factory buildings will become an art gallery .
Also in Krakow , the Gallery of 19th-century Polish Art will likely return to Cloth Hall on the Main Market Square , and three new stained-glass windows based on century-old designs by Polish Art Nouveau headliner Stanislaw Wyspianski are now displayed in the newly opened Wyspianski Pavilion .

Renovations at the Auschwitz Concentration Camp Museum continue .
The plan is to spread the existing exhibit through more buildings -- mostly on the ground floors -- to allow easier movement through this poignant memorial .

Warsaw is improving its infrastructure .
The Royal Way thoroughfare through the most historic stretch of town -- until recently a congested mess of potholed asphalt -- is being replaced with wide , beautifully landscaped sidewalks .
Once gloomy and urban , downtown Warsaw is fast becoming an appealing place to hang out .

In Gdansk , the wonderful 'Roads to Freedom ' museum ( about Lech Walesa and the Solidarity movement in the 1980s ) has moved to a temporary location not far from is original home in the shipyard where the protests took place .
That part of the shipyard will be renovated into a super-modern zone of shops and homes , with the museum moving back in a few years .
Other parts of the city are also undergoing a long-overdue redevelopment , in preparation for the Euro Cup soccer championship coming here in 2012 .

Hungary

In Budapest , a new tour company leads visitors through an old World War II-era military hospital and bunker under Castle Hill .
Just up the street from the Great Synagogue , Budapest 's Jewish community recently re-opened the Rumbach Street Synagogue , designed by the great Viennese architect Otto Wagner in the late 19th century .

In Eger , a delightful new Marzipan Museum shows off truly impressive sculptures by local marzipan artist Lajos Kopcsik , including a sword , minaret , gigantic wine bottle , suitcase , Russian stacking dolls , old-time phonograph , grandfather clock , giant bell ... and paintings galore ( such as Van Gogh 's sunflowers and Picasso 's musicians ) .
Who 'd have thought candy could be great art ?

Prague , Czech Republic

Renovation of the Charles Bridge , which began last year in conjunction with the bridge 's 650-year anniversary , continues .
The bridge , which connects the Old Town and Prague Castle , remains open ( and crossable ) even during construction .

Eastern Europe somehow feels like a modernized Old World and a new frontier all at once .
Whether you 're rambling the Riva or strolling across Charles Bridge , fascinated by modern history or marzipan , Eastern Europe is full of surprises for the intentional traveler .
