1 GENEVA , Switzerland -LRB- AP -RRB- -- Opera legend Joan Sutherland is recovering well after breaking both legs during a fall at her Swiss home , her agent said Monday .

1 ` She had an accident while doing the gardening , and somehow managed to break both her legs , ' agent David Sigall said .

1 The 81-year-old soprano is now in a Swiss hospital undergoing rehabilitation , Sigall told The Associated Press by telephone from London .

3 ` She has been moved to the rehabilitation section , ' he said , adding that Sutherland would likely remain there for up to eight weeks before being allowed to put any weight on her legs .

3 ` All is well except I 'm sure she 's not pleased , ' said Sigall , who had not yet spoken to Sutherland himself .

2 The accident occurred June 24 while the Australian singer was picking flowers in the garden and lost her balance , an assistant reached at Sutherland 's home near Montreux , told the AP .

3 The assistant , who asked not to be named , said Sutherland underwent successful surgery at a nearby hospital and was in good spirits .

3 Sutherland 's husband , conductor Richard Bonynge , initially canceled a planned performance with Opera Australia later this month but was convinced by Sutherland to carry out the engagement , the assistant said .

3 ` Mr. Bonynge has now gone to Australia ' to conduct Gaetano Donizetti 's ` Lucia di Lammermoor , ' Sigall said .

1 Sutherland 's performance in the difficult title role in a 1959 Covent Garden revival widely is seen as her breakthrough in an international career that lasted until 1991 .

3 Sigall said Sutherland had no previous accidents .
3 ` She 's always been in pretty robust health . '
