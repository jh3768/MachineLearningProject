1 Paraguay 's president wants to resign to start Senate term - CNN.com .
1 ASUNCION , Paraguay -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Paraguay 's President Nicanor Duarte offered Congress his resignation Monday , two months before his term is slated to end .

1 Duarte , a member of the ruling Colorado Party who was barred by law from running for a second five-year presidential term in last April 's elections , instead ran for and won a seat in Paraguay 's Senate .
1 New senators are to be sworn in on July 1 .

3 President-elect Fernando Lugo of the Patriotic Alliance for Change is slated to take office on August 15 .
3 He has supported Duarte 's right to resign .

3 But other opposition members and even some of Duarte 's own Colorado Party members oppose his bid , arguing the constitution does not allow the president to hold another position .
3 Several others said they would not show up , thereby denying him the quorum needed for approval .
3 They contend the constitution does not allow the president to occupy two offices at the same time , a rule intended to ensure the chief of state does not give short shrift to the job .

3 His resignation offer -- which would require approval from a majority of each house -- is slated for a vote on Tuesday .

3 ` I hope that the senators and representatives of the nation can complete their constitutional mandate to reject or accept my resignation , ' Duarte said during a nationally televised address .

3 He said he wants ` to continue serving the Paraguayan people ' from the legislature .

3 Meanwhile , he said , he will continue carrying out his duties as president .
