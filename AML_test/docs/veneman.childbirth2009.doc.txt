3 Commentary : When joy of pregnancy turns to heartbreak - CNN.com .
1 NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Every day in the United States , thousands of women and families experience one of the most joyous occasions in their lifetime -- the birth of a child .

1 That joy is certainly not as often the case in many parts of the world .
1 Women in the least-developed countries are 300 times more likely to die in childbirth or from complications related to pregnancy than women in developed countries .

2 Half a million women die due to pregnancy or childbirth complications every year .

1 The lack of the most basic necessities such as a doctor , nurse , clean water , supplies or even a medical facility is robbing precious innocence and devastating families .

1 Such services are often sorely lacking in the poorest regions of the world , particularly in Africa and Asia , which account for the vast majority of all worldwide maternal and newborn deaths .
3 Conflict , HIV and AIDS , migration and a lack of investment in public health services have made this devastating situation even worse .

3 In my travels to these regions , I have seen firsthand the impact of these challenges .
2 It 's heartbreaking to hear how women have to walk miles while in labor to reach the nearest hospital , only to arrive finding that there are no doctors available or that the conditions are unsanitary .
2 In many cases , both the mother and newborn lose their lives .

2 Unfortunately , stories like these are not uncommon .
3 I recently visited Sierra Leone , the country with the highest rate of under-5 mortality in the world .
3 One reason for this is that the vast majority of women do not breast-feed their children .

3 The women I talk with say it is custom to feed their children rice water .
3 This provides little nutritional value and leaves children susceptible to disease and death .
3 However , it is illustrative of the challenges we face in reducing child mortality rates .

2 Educating women , particularly young girls , about critical health issues is a priority for UNICEF .
3 The younger a girl is when she becomes pregnant , the greater the health risks for her and her baby .

3 Other factors such as sexual violence and other gender-related abuses pose tremendous challenges and increase the risk that adolescent girls will drop out of school .
3 This , in turn , entrenches the vicious cycle of gender discrimination , poverty and high rates of maternal and neonatal death .

3 A child born in Sierra Leone has more than an one in four chance of not living to see his or her first birthday .
3 That country also has the worst record for prenatal care .

3 Regular immunizations , vitamins , rehydration for children suffering from diarrhea and the use of bed nets to protect from malarial mosquitoes are simple and effective ways of keeping women and children alive .

1 Though the challenges to reach the most vulnerable are high , we are seeing important progress made through international support .
1 However , more can and must be done .

2 Through proven interventions at key stages in life and pregnancy , millions of women and children can be saved each year .
2 We know that the vast majority of maternal deaths are preventable when women have access to essential maternity and basic health-care services .

3 The most vital need is for more skilled professionals and medical facilities throughout pregnancy , birth and postnatal care .

3 UNICEF continues to work with other international agencies to bring more resources to accelerate progress .
1 These efforts are designed to reduce these deaths , and we are seeing some remarkable improvements .

3 In 2007 , while I was in Ethiopia helping open a clean water processing facility , a woman stood up and told me her story .
3 Every day , she would spend up to 10 hours in search of clean water to ensure her children could drink and eat .

3 With clean water now in her community , she can focus on keeping her children healthy and ensuring they are receiving a good education .

3 She knows , like so many women around the world in her situation , that the key to ending this suffering is through greater education , awareness and resources to help improve the lives and care of women and children .
3 By doing so , we can significantly reduce and eventually end this horrific loss of life .
