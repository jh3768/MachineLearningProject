3 Tevez scored 19 goals in 48 matches on loan last season to help United win the Premier League and Champions League , and British papers reported on Saturday that the club now wants to keep him permanently .

3 ` He 's definitely very keen to stay , ' agent Kia Joorabchian told Sky Sports on Saturday .
2  ` We 'll get there at some point -LRB- with the deal -RRB- , if not quite today . '

2 Joorabchian said it could still take weeks or months to conclude negotiations .

1 Papers including The Sun , The Mirror , The Mail and The Guardian said United will break the record of 30 million pounds paid by Chelsea for Andriy Shevchenko in 2006 .

3 The 24-year-old Tevez joined United a year ago after scoring the goals that saved West Ham from relegation in 2006-07 .

3 He was initially on a two-year loan because of the complicated nature of the transfer -- his registration was claimed by an investment group rather than a club -- but United also negotiated a clause to give it first refusal on signing him permanently .

3 Tevez came on as a substitute in United 's 4-0 win over Kaizer Chiefs on Saturday which completed their preseason tour of South Africa .
