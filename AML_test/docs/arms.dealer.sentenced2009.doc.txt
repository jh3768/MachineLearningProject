1 NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Syrian arms dealer was sentenced to 30 years in a U.S. federal prison for conspiring to sell weapons as part of a plot to kill Americans in Colombia , according to prosecutors .

1 Al-Kassar 's co-defendant Luis Felipe Moreno Godoy received a 25-year prison sentence for his role in the conspiracy .

3 Both men were convicted in November of five charges , including conspiracy to murder U.S. nationals , conspiracy to acquire and export anti-aircraft missiles , conspiracy to provide support for FARC guerrillas in Colombia , and money laundering .

1 The federal indictment paints al-Kassar as an international arms dealer with a hand in conflicts in nearly every part of the world , with a web of bank accounts and front companies across Europe and the Middle East .

3 Al-Kassar was arrested in Spain in 2007 on a U.S. warrant and his associat ccce Moreno Godoy was arrested in Romania .

1 Justice Department officials say al-Kassar has been a source of weapons and military equipment for armed combatants since the 1970s .
