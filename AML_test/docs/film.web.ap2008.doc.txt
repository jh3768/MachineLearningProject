3 AOL exec opens Web door for film - CNN.com .
3 NEW YORK -LRB- AP -RRB- -- Retired AOL executive Ted Leonsis is turning his passion for documentaries into an Internet service meant to give independent filmmakers broader viewership .

2 His new Web site , SnagFilms , will take professionally produced documentaries like ` Super Size Me ' and some from National Geographic and PBS and show them for free at the site -- or embed them in profile pages at Facebook , MySpace and other social networking hangouts .

1 Fifteen-second ads will run every eight to 10 minutes , with revenue split between SnagFilms and the filmmakers .

3 Leonsis , who explored the Internet 's distribution potential as vice chairman at Time Warner Inc. 's AOL , said the idea for SnagFilms grew out of his work on ` Nanking , ' his entry into filmmaking .

3 ` Nanking , ' which won an editing award last year at the Sundance Film Festival and was released in theaters , chronicles the brutal Japanese occupation of the Chinese city in 1937 .

2 Leonsis said the experience opened his eyes to the plight of filmmakers , particularly for documentaries .

3 ` Every year , more and more of these films are being made , and less and less are getting distribution , ' Leonsis said .
3 ` That is a problem for filmmakers and also a problem for the causes these filmmakers have been -LRB- championing -RRB- when they are telling their story . '

3 Leonsis said he plans to eventually make ` Nanking ' and his second movie , ` Kicking It , ' available on SnagFilms .

1 Leonsis is the new venture 's majority owner , but he turned to many of his former AOL colleagues , including co-founder Steve Case , for funding .
3 AOL is providing technical and advertising help .
3 Former National Geographic executive Rick Allen , who worked with Leonsis on ` Kicking It , ' will be its chief executive .

3 AOL and CNN belong to parent Time Warner .
