3 Odd behavior is n't the only way to ruin your chances of landing a job .

3 To ensure your interview is smooth and error-free , follow these five tips .

3 &#8226; Do some research : When you walk into a job interview , knowledge of the company 's history , goals and current activity proves to the interviewer that you are not only prepared for the interview , but also that you want to be a part of the organization .

3 &#8226; Do n't lie : If the conversation drifts to a topic you 're not knowledgeable about , admit you do n't know the answer and then explain how you would go about finding a solution .
3 Displaying your problem-solving skills is better than babbling about something you do n't understand .

3 &#8226; Keep it professional : Although interviewers often try to create a comfortable setting to ease the job seeker 's nerves , business decorum should n't disappear .
3 Avoid offering personal details that can be controversial or have no relevance to the position , such as political and religious beliefs or stories about a recent break-up .

3 &#8226; Know what to expect : Expect to hear staple interview questions : ` What 's your biggest weakness ? '
3 ` Why do you want to work here ? '
3 ` Tell me about yourself . '
3 ` Why did you leave your last job ? '
3 These open-ended questions are harder to answer than they sound , so think about your responses before the interview .

3 &#8226; Put on a happy face : The interview is not the time to air your grievances about being wronged by a past boss .
2 How you speak about a previous employer gives the hiring manager an idea of how you 'll speak about him or her once you 've moved on .

3 Unfortunately , many job seekers are not only ignoring these tips , they 're making mistakes that leave unforgettable impressions for all the wrong reasons .
