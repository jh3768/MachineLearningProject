1 Pinki brings a smile to the Oscars - CNN.com .
2 -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- While all eyes seem to be on ` Slumdog Millionaire ' for the Oscars , one very courageous little girl will be focused on another India-based film at the ceremony .

1 It 's called ` Smile Pinki , ' and it 's up for an Oscar , too -- nominated for best short documentary , which it won on Sunday .

1 The little girl watching it from inside the Oscar ceremony has traveled all the way to Los Angeles , California , from her small Indian village with her dad -- and it has been an incredible journey for Pinki Sonkar .

3 ` Smile Pinki ' tells the story of her transformation from a sad outcast to a vibrant 8-year-old with plenty of spunk .

1 Pinki was born with a cleft lip , and her impoverished family did not have the money for corrective surgery .

2 Like millions of other children born with the lip deformity in developing countries , Pinki simply had to live with it and suffer the social consequences .

2 Her father Rajendra Sonkar says : ` She used to go to school and the kids would not befriend her .
3 She would say , ` I do n't want to go to school . ''

2 ` Pinki was a depressed , sad , lonely , shy , young little girl , growing up on the periphery of the society in a little village , ' said Satish Kalra , director of Smile Train 's South Asian region , after meeting with Pinki .

3 The little girl 's own family was ashamed of her , Kalra says .

3 But all of that has changed .
1 Pinki is now a real pistol , full of energy and confidence , and she has a fantastic smile too -- thanks to the Smile Train charity .

1 Smile Train teaches doctors in their own countries to operate on cleft lips , a deformity afflicting up to four million children across the world .

2 Pinki just happened to be one of the chosen candidates for surgery and was also chosen to be the subject of the documentary .

3 The film chronicles her transformation , following her from her village to the hospital and home again .

3 ` She has absolutely and totally changed , ' said Pinki 's surgeon , Dr. Subodh Kumar .

3 The film 's director is Megan Mylan .
2 She has won several awards but not an Oscar -- until now .

3 For Pinki and her dad , being able to see the film 's director win an Oscar would be a thrill .

3 But they know they already have the greatest prize : Pinki 's new smile .

3 ` I am so happy that my daughter 's lips have been repaired , ' her dad Rajendra said with a smile , expressing hope that the movie will inspire people to help children whose families ca n't afford the surgery .
