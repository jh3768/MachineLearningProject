1 Experts meet to fight Mexican narcotraffickers - CNN.com .
1 MEXICO CITY , Mexico -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Ciudad Juarez was converted into a fortress as members of President Felipe Calderon 's security cabinet met Wednesday in the border town to devise a strategy to combat narcotraffickers .

1 Ciudad Juarez , across the U.S. border from El Paso , Texas , is one of the most violent cities in Mexico , with the vast majority of the violence tied to drug trafficking .

3 The secretary of the interior , Fernando Gomez Mont , who attended the meeting , said the city remains under government control and promised greater cooperation between federal and local authorities .

2 ` Not a centimeter of the plaza will be ceded to them , and we are going to expel them from Juarez , ' he vowed , referring to the narcotraffickers .

3 ` That is the gist of our promise and in that we put our word . '

3 But last week , the chief of police was obliged to quit , after threats from organized crime to kill a policeman every day that he remained on the job .

3 A day later , the mayor was threatened with death .

3 Leo Zuckerman , a security expert who visited Juarez on Friday , disagreed with Gomez 's view .

3 ` I can assure you that what we are seeing is the loss of control of the state on the society , ' he said .

3 ` It is organized crime that is governing Ciudad Juarez ; they had the ability to force out the chief of police . '

3 Some opposition legislators and even the mayor have asked Mexican federal authorities for more help .

1 The violence generated by the war of the drug cartels for control of drug routes translated last year into some 6,000 killings .
3 More than 1,200 of them occurred in Ciudad Juarez alone .

3 During the meeting of the security cabinet , soldiers discovered an explosive at the airport , authorities said .
