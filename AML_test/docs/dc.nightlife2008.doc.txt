2 New late-night spots in D.C. - CNN.com .
3 -LRB- Budget Travel -RRB- -- It 's 8 p.m. on a Friday , and a fashionable group of men and women is sitting around the pewter bar at Proof on Washington , D.C. 's G Street .
3 ` Do you cook ? '
3 asks a 30-something lawyer with shaggy black hair as she tilts a glass of red wine toward the guy next to her .
3 ` If my apartment had come without a kitchen , ' he replies with a grin , ` I would n't have noticed . '
3 Everyone laughs knowingly .

1 In the last few years , as more young professionals and empty nesters have bought homes in the nation 's capital , D.C. has shifted from being a city of chilly Federal buildings to a place where cutting-edge restaurants , late-night caf s , and underground bars open more frequently than local politicians are busted for scandals .

2 Brasserie Beck is one of several large , bistro-style restaurants that debuted last year .
3 Designed to look like a train terminal , Beck runs about the length of a block , with train-station clocks set to different time zones .
3 The 100-beer selection is equally impressive : There are nine on draft , such as Campus , a pilsner from Belgium that 's exclusive to Beck .
3 The menu -- steamed mussels served with frites , duck almondine -- was crafted by chef Robert Wiedmaier , who also opened Marcel 's , the city 's premier French restaurant .

2 Central Michel Richard , started by the chef who made Citronelle one of the nation 's top restaurants , has a playful interior , with leaning towers of plates stacked around the dining room .
3 The bistro is often populated with D.C. celebrities -- that is , lobbyists , lawmakers and media types -- who like to rev up an evening at the marble bar with a clementine mimosa .
3 But the real draw is Richard 's food , which comes with a more reasonable price tag than Citronelle 's .
3 Most of the dishes , from a ` faux gras ' terrine -LRB- made with chicken -RRB- to braised rabbit with spaetzle , do n't top $ 20 .

3 Just north is the historic corridor of U Street .
3 Classic pit stops like Ben 's Chili Bowl , a diner that 's been around since 1958 , are wedged between old and new clubs that play host to jazz musicians .
3 In the 1930s , Duke Ellington often performed on U Street , then called Black Broadway .
3 Some of the fiercest Saturday-night sessions are held at HR-57 , which takes its name from a 1987 congressional directive that called on Americans to preserve jazz .

3 Right off U Street is Busboys and Poets , a bookstore that also has a caf , a theater , a bar and a restaurant that serves pizzas .
3 At one end , hipsters browse for books near a photo collage of Martin Luther King Jr. ; at the other , friends sip microbrews and watch a film about the Bush administration .
3 Busboys and Poets is an homage to Langston Hughes , who rose to prominence in D.C. while working as a busboy .

2 The area of Adams Morgan has been undergoing its own renaissance .
1 It 's still popular with the college crowd , but there are now a few nightspots that appeal to a more sophisticated clientele .
1 Bourbon , on 18th Street , is the place for bourbon aficionados : The 140-plus pours include a 16-year-old Black Maple Hill bourbon from Kentucky with hints of brown sugar .

3 One block west is another atypical retreat .
2 Named after the Paris subway , Metropolitain is a subterranean bar -LRB- below a bistro named Napoleon -RRB- specializing in champagne and other sparkling wines .
3 The decor is inspired by the 1970s , with gold-and-white wallpaper and cushiony leather couches -- but there 's no sitting around after 10 p.m. , when DJs spin disco .

1 Champagne also gets prime placement at Proof , where some 40 bottles of bubbly and wine are available in pours ranging from two to eight ounces .
3 Portraits of George Washington and Hillary Clinton flash across flat-screens above the bar .
3 Proof , like many things in the nation 's capital , was inspired by the founding fathers .
3 In this case , it 's a nod to Benjamin Franklin , whom the bar quotes as saying , ` Wine is proof that God loves us . '
