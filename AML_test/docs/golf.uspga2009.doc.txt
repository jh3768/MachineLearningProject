1 -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Pat Perez continued to lead after the third round of the Bob Hope Classic but fellow American Steve Stricker took close order after a brilliant 11-under 61 in California .

3 Perez , who opened with rounds of 61 and 62 in the 90-hole tournament , owed his two shot lead over Stricker to a five-birdie burst in his closing nine holes on the way to a 67 .

2 Stricker tied Charlie Wi for best round of the day in a low-scoring event , as he chases his first win since 2007 .

3 ` I just gave myself a lot of opportunities today , ' Stricker told the Press Association .

3 ` I kept the ball in play , hit some close shots , made a couple of lengthy putts and everything that you need to do in an 11-under round , I guess I did .

3 ` I guess the biggest thing was I gave myself a lot of opportunities and did n't make any mistakes . '

3 Perez , a 32-year-old chasing his first PGA Tour win , is putting thoughts of a breakthrough victory on the back burner .

3 ` No , I wo n't think about that at any point , ' he said .

3 ` I 'm just going to try to go as low as I can and make a lot of putts .
3 That 's all I 'm going to do . '

3 Vaughan Taylor is three shots back while David Berganio , Chris Stroud , Richard Johnson and Jason Dufner are all four shots off the lead .

3 The annual event , now hosted by golfing legend Arnold Palmer , is being played over four courses and features a first prize of $ 918,000 .
