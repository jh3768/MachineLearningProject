2 UK public sector workers strike over pay - CNN.com .
2 LONDON , England -LRB- AP -RRB- -- Thousands of British local government employees began a two-day strike over pay on Wednesday .

1 Unions said they expected more than half a million workers in England , Wales and Northern Ireland to join the walkout that began at a minute past midnight -LRB- 2301GMT Tuesday -RRB- , closing museums , libraries , civic offices and some schools .

1 The workers are members of public sector unions and include library staff , garbage collectors and school support staff .

1 Union members have rejected the offer of a 2.45-percent pay increase , saying it is far below the rate of inflation .
3 They want a 6-percent raise .

3 Official figures released this week put Britain 's main inflation measure at 3.8 percent in June amid rising costs for gasoline and staple foods .

3 Local government employers say any pay increase above 2.45 percent would have to be funded through higher taxes and service cuts .

3 The unions disagree , and say their mostly low-paid members are taking a real-terms pay cut .

2 ` The growing gap between wages and inflation is the reason why thousands of council workers will reluctantly be going on strike , ' said Brendan Barber , general secretary of union federation the Trades Union Congress .

3 Britain has seen a growing number of strikes as Prime Minister Gordon Brown 's government attempts to dampen down public-sector salaries and spending to keep a lid on inflation .
