1 Ogilvy sixth in world after Hawaii win - CNN.com .
1 -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Geoff Ogilvy surged five places to sixth in the world following his six-stroke triumph at the season-opening Mercedes-Benz Championship in Hawaii on Sunday .

1 The Australian entered the final round at Kapalua 's Plantation Course with a six shot lead , but made a poor start saw his advantage whittled down to just one after eight holes .

1 Ogilvy , 31 , had bogeys at the first two holes and dropped two more shots before fighting back with an eagle at the ninth -- and playing a seven-hole stretch in seven-under-par .

1 He reeled off a run of four birdies from the 12th to fly away from the field with a closing five-under-par 68 leaving him at 24-under -- clear of Anthony Kim and Davis Love III who closed with 67s .

3 Sean O'Hair fired the day 's best round of eight-under 65 to move up to fourth on 17 under , a shot ahead of Justin Leonard ( 70 ) .

3 South Africa 's Ernie Els ( 67 ) shared sixth with American trio Zach Johnson ( 67 ) , Kenny Perry ( 70 ) and DJ Trahan ( 71 ) on 15 under .

3 Open and U.S. PGA champion Padraig Harrington , meanwhile , moved up from fourth to third in the world without competing .

3 Harrington launches his 2009 campaign in Abu Dhabi this week , but because the rankings are calculated over a rolling two-year period he has moved ahead of Phil Mickelson .

3 Number two Sergio Garcia is also in the Middle East and he and Harrington are looking to close the gap on Tiger Woods , whose long injury lay-off has given both the chance to claim the top spot in the next few months .

2 Top 20 in the world rankings : 1 Tiger Woods 11.36 pts , 2 Sergio Garcia 7.88 , 3 Padraig Harrington 6.71 , 4 Phil Mickelson 6.71 , 5 Vijay Singh 6.54 , 6 Geoff Ogilvy 5.31 , 7 Robert Karlsson 4.95 , 8 Camilo Villegas 4.75 , 9 Anthony Kim 4.74 , 10 Ernie Els 4.61 11 Lee Westwood 4.59 , 12 Henrik Stenson 4.58 , 13 Jim Furyk 4.29 , 14 Kenny Perry 3.92 , 15 Steve Stricker 3.76 , 16 Stewart Cink 3.74 , 17 KJ Choi 3.71 , 18 Adam Scott 3.71 , 19 Justin Rose 3.40 , 20 Trevor Immelman 3.39
