1 LEEDS , England -LRB- AP -RRB- -- South Africa took a lead of 119 over England with six first innings wickets standing before bad light ended play early in the second Test at Headingley .

1 They closed at 322-4 and Ashwell Prince was 134 not out , and A.B. de Villiers unbeaten on 70 .

1 Their fifth-wicket partnership of 179 was a record for South Africa against England at Leeds .

1 Prince , who scored 101 in the drawn first Test at Lord 's , reached his second hundred of the series with a characteristic flick off his hip from the bowling of James Anderson just before tea .

3 Prince had brought up his 50 midway through the afternoon session by crashing Monty Panesar for six over mid on .

3 De Villiers provided able support as South Africa completely dominated both the afternoon and evening sessions before the weather intervened .

3 England captain Michael Vaughan frequently rotated his bowlers but was unable to make the breakthrough even with the new ball four overs before tea .

3 England fast bowler Darren Pattinson , making a controversial debut , had Amla leg before wicket for 38 , but that was the only wicket to fall in the day .
3 Even that was questionable , umpire Daryl Harper deciding the ball would have gone on to hit leg stump , although replays suggested otherwise .

2 South Africa added 57 runs in 23 overs in the morning session after resuming in the morning on 101-3 .
