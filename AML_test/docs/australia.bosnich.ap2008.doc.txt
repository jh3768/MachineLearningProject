1 Keeper Bosnich back with a clean sheet - CNN.com .
1 SYDNEY , Australia -LRB- AP -RRB- -- Mark Bosnich saved a penalty and kept a clean sheet in a spectacular comeback to football Sunday , six years after the drug-fuelled collapse of his career in England 's Premier League .

1 Bosnich , now 36 , played a major role in Central Coast 's 3-0 win over Sydney in an Australian A-League pre-season cup match at Gosford in New South Wales state .

1 The former Aston Villa , Manchester United and Chelsea ` keeper was cheered loudly by more than 7,000 spectators as he made several spectacular saves in the match at rainy Bluetongue Stadium .

1 The match was Bosnich 's first on Australian soil since 1999 and his first Australian club match for 20 years .

3 After a quiet start , the former Australia international had the chance to show he had lost little of his agility when he tipped a powerful shot over the crossbar in the 28-minute .

1 In the second half , he produced a similarly spectacular save from a curling Mitchell Prentice shot and capped a flawless debut for Central Coast with a 59th-minute penalty save from a Steve Corica spotkick .

3 The performance boosted Bosnich 's chances of winning a longer-term contract with Central Coast , where he is on trial .

3 Mariners coach Lawrie McKinna said before the match he was ready to hand a lifeline to Bosnich who 's Premier League career crashed amid drug abuse , depression and tawdry tabloid tales of video sex romps .

3 Bosnich said the match would give him a reference point to determine how his comeback was progressing .

3 ` I 'm under no illusions here , ' he said .

3 ` I 'm here on trial .
3 Forget past reputations , I have to perform . '

3 The Mariners have a medium-term vacancy due to the suspension of first-choice goalkeeper Danny Vukovic until October for hitting the referee in last year 's grand final .
