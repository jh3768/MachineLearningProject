3 Toro Rosso has shown improved form since introducing their new car at Monaco , with Vettel finishing in the points in two of the four races since then .

3 ` I am very proud to be joining Red Bull Racing and it 's always good to have an early decision on what you are doing next year , ' Vettel said .
