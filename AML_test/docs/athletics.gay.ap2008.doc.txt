1 Gay diagnosed with leg muscle injury - CNN.com .
1 EUGENE , Oregon -LRB- AP -RRB- -- Sprinter Tyson Gay has a mild strain in a muscle in the back of his leg and has been told to restrict himself to light physical activity for the next two weeks .

1 Gay pulled up abruptly in the first 40 meters of his 200-meter qualifying race on Saturday at the U.S. Olympic trials and had to be carted off the track .

2 He was diagnosed with a severe cramp in his hamstring , and an MRI that afternoon revealed the extent of the strain .

1 A statement from his representatives said : ` Tyson is expected to engage in active rest for up to 12-14 days , with light physical activity increasing through that period -- then resume training . '

3 Gay revealed : ` Before I went out on the track I felt a little tightness in my hamstring .
3 So I had kind of a bad feeling .

2 ` When I came off the curve the first two steps were fine , and then I felt it , sort of a pull , about 40 meters in .
3 Once I was on the ground it did n't hurt as much as when it happened .
3 It 's just one of those things . '

3 The only race Gay is signed up for before the Olympics is the 100 meters at the London Grand Prix on July 24-25 at Crystal Palace .

3 Gay , the defending world champion in both the 100m and 200m , had already qualified for the Olympic 100 meters .
3 That competition begins on August 15 in Beijing .
3 If he can run , he would also be expected to be part of the 400-meter relay team .

3 But his chance for a medal in the 200m is now gone because of the injury .
3 USA Track and Field rules state that only the top three finishers in an event qualify for the Olympics , regardless of an athlete 's past record or any injuries .
