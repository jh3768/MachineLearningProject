Campbell Brown : We gave Senate appointee Roland Burris the benefit of the doubt .
Our faith in Rod Blagojevich 's choice was misplaced , Brown says .
Brown says Burris dodged questions and was n't truthful about appointment .
We 've been burned once by Burris , Brown warns ; do n't let it happen again .
